<p>The presenters, Madeline and Ann announced the purpose. Because well-organized groups of Indivisible already exist on east and west sides of our town, this meeting was to announce her coach-ship. She has years at the head of Citizens Climate Action Lobby and now she prefers to stay lateral to the existing big Indivisible chapters: she can incubate and coach your little startups. So in a sense, Madeline was suggesting a Y-Combinator for democracy.   Too, it reminded me of the Kung Fu move as seen recently in Wu Kong's Journey to the West: power-of-a-thousand-hairs.</p>
<p>My impression, entering the room, is that this country is a cloud, waiting for a seed crystal. Attendance was high; people need little convincing to show up at a meeting like this and do something like they've never done before.</p>
<p>When she said &quot;watched any Indivisible trainings?&quot;  only five hands went up out of fifty people. So this is still early days of spreading the word, unfortunately.  Note to myself: plenty of flyering and door to door to do around here.  The message could really be: have hope, as you see fit, either join the <a href="http://madisonindivisibleeast.org">madisonindivisibleeast.org</a>, or call Madeline for loose coaching, or at least, get on the phone tree: start getting news from #nokings and similar phone trees of information.</p>
<p>(We are so far behind schedule. We are in a rebuilding year, but at least we have a team and we are not getting relegated down a league. We are too late to save the next couple of years.  Indivisible will be great for a 60 month plan.  For the 18 month plan, we can at least be an ally, like Sunrise Movement, hoping that a hero at the top steps up.  Maybe that will be the 18 month hope: our meager moves now can force-multiply to enable a hero in the top places. Like the heros in top places of 2020.)</p>
