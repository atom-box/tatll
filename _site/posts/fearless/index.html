<p>I wish I had known about this book when I was a mentor of tenth graders.  Back then I was too focused on teaching chemistry. I could have added this sort of coaching and pep talks and reached a totally different part of my audience.</p>
<p>There's great Growth Mindset tips in this book, concretized. I'm putting all the nuggets here now. Surely I will get a chance to use these in a coaching situation.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<h2 id="be-focused" tabindex="-1">Be Focused <a class="direct-link" href="#be-focused" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you feel overwhelmed, find one small task to take.</li>
<li>Dwell on what you want, rather than what worries you.</li>
<li>Start with envy.  Envy isn't shameful, it's powerful.</li>
<li>Make plans to make progress.  Once you see the path, you can take it.</li>
<li>Spend time planning, not worrying or escaping.</li>
<li>When you think about what you crave, desire, and wish for -- how do you feel?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-hopeful" tabindex="-1">Be Hopeful <a class="direct-link" href="#be-hopeful" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Think of your future self as the child of your current self</li>
<li>Just treading water is important work. Don't feel bad if you aren't taking &quot;huge leaps forward&quot;.</li>
<li>Train the voice in your head to give pep talks, not put downs.  Think you're lucky? You will be lucky. (This is a form of gratitude.) XXX</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-resourceful" tabindex="-1">Be Resourceful <a class="direct-link" href="#be-resourceful" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Every obstacle is a resource. Your current situation contains all of the components of your future success. It's a puzzle you can solve any way you want. The present is like an escape room: People pay to be in these things and then solve the way forward.</li>
<li>Leverage the riches youu have.</li>
<li>Stop asking for chances; start taking them without permission.</li>
<li>Fear not what others think. Opinions in the world = [infinity symbol]. There are hundreds of thumbs down, terrible reviews of <em>everything</em>, even Anne Frank's diary</li>
<li>Treasure your nemesis. When you get your awards someday, thank your nemesis. Love is a scary-strong source of strength. Put your energy into waging peace; fear has no traction when love takes the wheel. XXX</li>
<li>Don't give up before you begin. If the worst that could happen is that you learn something new, why not just go for what you want? XXX</li>
<li>Keep a go to kit: Your most trussted friend and all their contact information. Your favorite place to be and how to get there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-earnest" tabindex="-1">Be Earnest <a class="direct-link" href="#be-earnest" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Heroes dare to fix what's busted. Notice -&gt; Ignore -&gt; multiplied problem. Notice -&gt; Fix -&gt; <a href="http://Solved.XXX">Solved.XXX</a></li>
<li>If you don't ask for help, nobody will know you need it.</li>
<li>Nobody ever did anything amazing nonchalantly. Anything worth doing is worth doing with an intense and potentially embarrassing amount of energy.</li>
<li>Action.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-connected" tabindex="-1">Be Connected <a class="direct-link" href="#be-connected" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Connect with those who share your focus.</li>
<li>Volunteer to do this. Do it in public.</li>
<li>Exile is a form of punishment. And remember, you are the missing piece of someone else's puzzle.</li>
<li>Sort your surrounders: recognize which people around you speak in helpful terms. XXX</li>
<li>Put your connecting techniques to work: Compliment others 2x as much as you think you should. Be welcoming, not gate keeping whenever you meet anyone new.</li>
<li>Invite as many people to as many things as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-aware" tabindex="-1">Be Aware <a class="direct-link" href="#be-aware" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Check in with yourself often.</li>
<li>Give everyone more credit. The iceberg of obliviousness: what we see/what's really going on with them.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why you spend your time the way you do. Avoiding your destiny often looks like a schedule full of nothing of importance.</li>
<li>Doing fewer things means doing bigger things.</li>
</ul>
