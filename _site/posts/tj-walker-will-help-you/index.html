<h2 id="udemy:-complete-communication-skills" tabindex="-1">Udemy: Complete Communication Skills <a class="direct-link" href="#udemy:-complete-communication-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>A gigantic course cobbled together from TJ Walker's two hundred mini videos. These are notes I took while listening to TJ talking about talking.</p>
<h2 id="all-communication" tabindex="-1">All communication <a class="direct-link" href="#all-communication" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>All communication should be judged by what your listeners retain. And whether they then <em>do</em> something.<br>
Your goal is to be memorable and to have a call to action.</p>
<h2 id="powerpoint" tabindex="-1">Powerpoint <a class="direct-link" href="#powerpoint" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>His preference: don't.<br>
There's no such thing as &quot;a tech talk&quot;, &quot;a data talk&quot;, &quot;a formal defense&quot;, &quot;a powerpoint presentation&quot;.  He says there's only two kinds of presentations: ones that achieve an action by the listener and ones that don't.  And Powerpoint has to be the icing of your talk, and therefore can be omitted and there's still a talk. So in that case, consider just having a piece of paper (single piece should last you up to one hour!), and walking around the space.</p>
<h2 id="but-if-you-choose-powerpoint" tabindex="-1">But if you choose Powerpoint <a class="direct-link" href="#but-if-you-choose-powerpoint" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>If you must: one idea per slide as an anchor to your talk.<br>
Or consider: just an image per slide, nothing else.<br>
Write, prepare, practice the whole thing, without starting to write the ppt.  Once you have a talk, author the slides.  This forces them to hold no info: just be icing and reinforcement.<br>
When you present the talk, never face the slide and read it. There should be nought to read anyway.<br>
Use <em>w</em> or <em>b</em> to turn off the slides while you talk. Hit any key to resume.<br>
Get a clicker-changer that does not multifunction: stay small, just a clicker.  He doesn't like slide changer assistants (to me he is being silly 80s-man).</p>
<h2 id="sort-of-a-wild-ppt-idea" tabindex="-1">Sort of a wild ppt idea <a class="direct-link" href="#sort-of-a-wild-ppt-idea" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Wild idea: his rhythm for ppting is:</p>
<ol>
<li>with no slide, start your point</li>
<li>no slide, give an example story</li>
<li>still no slide, maybe teach a mnemonic</li>
<li>finally a slide: reviewing the point - and the slide is just a diagram or photo, few or no words</li>
</ol>
<p>Golden rule - your ppt goal is for the audience to take some action, going forward.  So, memorize in them a couple of your points.  That means 2 to 5 points, tops. Your lists and high detail belong in a handout, or website they can hit later, or it is a great excuse to get their email address so you have an excuse to get in touch with them.</p>
<p>Who's the boss? Bad presenters let the powerpoint control them and prompt them. Don't do that.  You be the boss, the ppt works for you.</p>
<h2 id="abstraction-is-your-enemy" tabindex="-1">Abstraction is your enemy <a class="direct-link" href="#abstraction-is-your-enemy" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p><em>But TJ, I don't have a story for that part.</em><br>
His response is, <em>that probably means its not an important point</em>.</p>
<h2 id="story-i-zing-things" tabindex="-1">Story-i-zing Things <a class="direct-link" href="#story-i-zing-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Stories have details.<br>
They have settings.<br>
You have emotions, the other people have full names, and you speak dialogue.</p>
<p>This should feel like a radio drama.</p>
<p>Mention the weather, avoid pronouns, have 5 senses (sounds, tactile, ...).  BUT DON'T GET SHAGGY: do all this briskly enough that Meg Domroese doesn't fidget.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-yourself" tabindex="-1">Introducing yourself <a class="direct-link" href="#introducing-yourself" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Remember, your goal is to be memorable and to have a call to action.<br>
So even when you're at a camp or meeting and it is time to go around in a circle, he witholds his name for a bit.</p>
<p>Don't say name/job/company at beginning!</p>
<p>Do:<br>
1 - start by posing a problem they can relate to.<br>
2 - then say your name<br>
3 - incentivize them to interact with you later, with a freebie or an intrigue of mystery<br>
4 - 30 seconds maximum</p>
<h2 id="notes" tabindex="-1">Notes <a class="direct-link" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>One sheet: it's a bad speech if you can't talk from a single sheet.<br>
No levels of indenting or hierarchy.<br>
Your triggering your stories.<br>
Remember you should only be making 5, 3, or even 2 points. Studies show that nobody will hang onto it otherwise. In which case, why did you even talk?<br>
Your talk made for Powerpoint during a power failure should still work, because when you were writing a <em>TJ-style</em> talk, you edited your talk down to a single piece of paper, adequate for walking around the space - you only wrote your Powerpoint slides at the end, if you are TJ Walker, so a tech failure shouldn't bother you.  You revert to that single piece of paper.</p>
<h2 id="content-of-a-story" tabindex="-1">Content of a story <a class="direct-link" href="#content-of-a-story" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Describe a real problem.<br>
Relate a real conversation about that.<br>
Emphasize how you all felt.<br>
Solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="persuasion" tabindex="-1">Persuasion <a class="direct-link" href="#persuasion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Know the finish line.<br>
It's a numbers game. Aim for 75% failure.<br>
Improve a little bit each time: always be getting 2% better. It adds up. But to do that you need a feedback mechanism, a reflective practice.<br>
10,000 hours rule.</p>
<h2 id="the-eye-contact" tabindex="-1">The Eye Contact <a class="direct-link" href="#the-eye-contact" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>90% of us do <em>windshield wiper eyes</em> when we publicly speak. We sweep the room, hitting all the corners.  TJ says it's a major, major advantage if you can switch that over to a Bill Clinton eye style.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton will talk to one person, for 4 or so sentences, face to face.  Then move along and repeat that.</p>
<h2 id="don't-multitask-your-listeners" tabindex="-1">Don't multitask your listeners <a class="direct-link" href="#don't-multitask-your-listeners" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Just talk.<br>
Just show some text.<br>
Just give a handout.</p>
