      <h1>We Rode the Amtrak Sleeper Car to New Orleans</h1>

<p>We Rode the Amtrak Sleeper Car to New Orleans</p>
<h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="direct-link" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We took the City of New Orleans from Chicago Union Station to Louisiana's New Orleans.<br>
I would do it again.  For me, the excitement was similar to the first time I ever flew: totally mind-blowing.  But it was also deeply relaxing, spiritual.  It took me somewhere in my mind where I hadn't been in awhile.</p>
<p>The cost was not prohibitively higher than flying.  I think a one way flight (Chicago - New Orleans) was ~300 dollars and one person in the berth was ~400.</p>
<h2 id="getting-on-the-train" tabindex="-1">Getting on the train <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-on-the-train" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The Chicago station has a special waiting lounge adjacent to the Great Hall (where they filmed Kevin Costner's The Untouchables).  Its entrance is a little beyond the &quot;privacy pod for breast feeding&quot;, which looks like a small arcade ride.</p>
<p>The sleeper car has no seats, it is all &quot;rooms&quot;.  The manager of the car circulates, checking on everything, well into the night, and early the next morning.  I think he was up until 1am and then awoke at 5am as far as I can tell.  You shouldn't say &quot;Oh, there's no need.&quot;  Let him do his thing.  He pops into your berth around 10pm to do the sheets. He visits again around 9am to put the bed away.  We tipped $15 for our one night; I don't know what is customary.</p>
<p>We had the smallest room (maybe called a <em>Sleep-ette</em>?).  It was like a bunk bed in a submarine.  The mattress is the width of a really wide lounger chair. The top berth has a safety web so you are less likely to roll out.  It was a bit acrobatic getting into the top bunk -- not sure what older folks do, especially since 60% of the sleeper car passengers were old folks.</p>
<h2 id="sleeping" tabindex="-1">Sleeping <a class="direct-link" href="#sleeping" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I slept great: woke up a few times when we hit Louisville or St Louis.</p>
<h2 id="reading" tabindex="-1">Reading <a class="direct-link" href="#reading" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I brought a good book.  If you like to read, a one day train trip is heavenly.  It's great to pass a whole morning or afternoon reading in the sky car, drinking hot beverages and saying Hi to people.</p>
<h2 id="eating" tabindex="-1">Eating <a class="direct-link" href="#eating" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The food was fine.  They definitely try hard.   It is similar to eating on an airplane 20 years ago.  The cost is included with the sleeper car fees.</p>
