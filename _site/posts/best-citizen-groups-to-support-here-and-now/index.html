<p><em>Which groups have done the most to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision? Are they conservative or liberal?</em></p>
<p>Efforts to overturn the Supreme Court‚Äôs <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> (2010) decision have come overwhelmingly from <strong>liberal and progressive</strong> groups. These organizations argue that <em>Citizens United</em> unleashed a flood of corporate and dark money into American politics by allowing unlimited independent political spending by corporations and unions.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Public Citizen</strong></p>
<ul>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conservative-efforts" tabindex="-1">Conservative Efforts? <a class="direct-link" href="#conservative-efforts" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Very few <strong>conservative</strong> or <strong>right-leaning</strong> groups have made <em>reversing</em> <em>Citizens United</em> a priority. In fact, many prominent conservative legal organizations, such as the <strong>Federalist Society</strong>, <strong>Heritage Foundation</strong>, and others, <strong>supported</strong> the <em>Citizens United</em> ruling as a win for free speech. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>small number of libertarian-leaning</strong> or <strong>anti-corruption conservatives</strong> have criticized the effects of the ruling, especially on political transparency, but they have not mounted major campaigns to overturn it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary:" tabindex="-1">Summary: <a class="direct-link" href="#summary:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>most organized and active opposition</strong> to <em>Citizens United</em> has come from <strong>liberal and progressive groups</strong>, often tied to the broader movement for campaign finance reform. Conservative groups, by contrast, have largely <strong>supported or defended</strong> the ruling on First Amendment grounds.</p>
<p>Among the five groups‚Äî<strong>Move to Amend</strong>, <strong>Public Citizen</strong>, <strong>Common Cause</strong>, <strong>End Citizens United</strong>, and <strong>American Promise</strong>‚Äîthe group that has arguably made the <strong>most tangible progress</strong> toward overturning <em>Citizens United</em> is <strong>American Promise</strong>. Here's why:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="american-promise" tabindex="-1">ü•á <strong>American Promise</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#american-promise" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Achievement</strong>: Has built the <strong>broadest bipartisan and cross-partisan support</strong> for a constitutional amendment‚Äîcritical for actually passing one (which requires two-thirds of Congress and ratification by 38 states).</li>
<li><strong>State-Level Successes</strong>: Helped pass <strong>resolutions or ballot measures in over 20 states</strong> (e.g., Colorado, Montana, California, and Massachusetts) supporting an amendment to overturn <em>Citizens United</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Municipal Momentum</strong>: Hundreds of cities and towns have passed similar resolutions with American Promise‚Äôs support.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Appeal</strong>: Actively recruits conservatives and moderates, such as former Republican officials and military veterans, to speak on the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Role</strong>: Focuses heavily on organizing state-level action and building the conditions needed for ratification‚Äîa step others often leave out.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="move-to-amend" tabindex="-1"><strong>Move to Amend</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#move-to-amend" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Deep grassroots organizing and strong ideological clarity (‚Äúmoney is not speech, corporations are not people‚Äù).</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Introduced the ‚ÄúWe the People Amendment‚Äù in Congress multiple times, but has <strong>not gained substantial traction in Congress</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation</strong>: Less bipartisan appeal, so lower chance of building the coalition needed for constitutional change.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="end-citizens-united" tabindex="-1"><strong>End Citizens United</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#end-citizens-united" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Massive fundraising and candidate endorsements in federal elections (especially pro-reform Democrats).</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Helps elect candidates who <strong>oppose Citizens United</strong>, but focuses more on <strong>electoral wins</strong> than on constitutional amendments.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation</strong>: Deeply partisan, which limits broader amendment movement success.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="public-citizen-and-common-cause" tabindex="-1"><strong>Public Citizen</strong> and <strong>Common Cause</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#public-citizen-and-common-cause" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Long histories of effective policy advocacy, litigation, and public education.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Played major roles in lawsuits and in supporting other groups‚Äô campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation</strong>: Focus more broadly on campaign finance and democracy issues than on <em>Citizens United</em> specifically.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion:" tabindex="-1">Conclusion: <a class="direct-link" href="#conclusion:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>American Promise</strong> has made the most structural progress toward overturning <em>Citizens United</em> because it‚Äôs working to build the only thing that can actually do it: a <strong>constitutional amendment</strong> backed by a <strong>bipartisan supermajority</strong> across <strong>states and Congress</strong>. The road is long, but they're methodically working the required steps.</p>

<p>These groups are <strong>not all the same</strong>, but they each <strong>contribute to the normalization or advancement of fascist-adjacent politics</strong>‚Äîwhether through policy, violence, rhetoric, or disinformation. The <strong>greatest danger</strong> lies in the <strong>overlap between fringe militancy and mainstream legitimization</strong>, especially when political, judicial, and media systems fail to check them.</p>
