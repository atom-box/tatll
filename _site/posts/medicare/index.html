<p>Medicare for Dummies by Patricia Barry</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1:-nuts-and-bolts-(pp.-9-18)" tabindex="-1">Chapter 1: Nuts and Bolts  (pp. 9 - 18) <a class="direct-link" href="#chapter-1:-nuts-and-bolts-(pp.-9-18)" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p><em>$$$$</em><br>
Medicare part A - you already paid this, through your paychecks and taxes.<br>
Medicare part B - you have to pay a monthly premium, like it's health insurance.<br>
Yearly cap on out of pocket? Yes in (C) but NOT in (A, B)<br>
&quot;Medigap&quot; is what people buy as a cushion against the &quot;sky is the limit&quot; maximum out of pocket costs</p>
<p>Medicare has 4 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nursing stuff  (A)</li>
<li>Doctoring stuff (B)</li>
<li>&quot;Let's use a company like Blue Cross instead of Parts A|B&quot;</li>
<li>Pharmacy prescriptions (a subset of D, added during the Bush admin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some preventative cares (B):</p>
<ul>
<li>diabetes screening, training</li>
<li>flu shots</li>
<li>any doc ordered blood, urine test</li>
<li>exams of prostate, colon</li>
<li>any doc ordered imaging</li>
<li>annual wellness check up</li>
</ul>
<p>End of life! (A):</p>
<ul>
<li>hospice</li>
<li>palliative</li>
</ul>
<p>Old people living out their last years in a nursing home</p>
<ul>
<li>pay with your own money...til you're broke</li>
<li>once you're broke you apply for Medicaid and that pays for a much worse nursing home</li>
</ul>
<p>Long hospital recoveries:<br>
Days 1 - 60 are paid but then the co-pay becmes $300 and then $600 a day</p>
<p>Strange surprising part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Medicare costs money. It's a kind of health insurance company (by the US government) that has low premiums, cannot refuse you, BUT</li>
<li>will make you pay an elevated fee for the rest of your life (!) if you forget to join when you turn 65 or within a few months of leaving your work insurance if you are over 65.</li>
<li>Here is a screenshot of that confusing point:<br>
(screeenshot to go here from Medicare for Dummies)</li>
