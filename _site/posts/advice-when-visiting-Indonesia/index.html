      <h1>Advice when visiting Indonesia</h1>

<time datetime="2023-04-14">14 Apr 2023</time><a href="/tags/travel/" class="post-tag">travel</a>

<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="direct-link" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a letter of advice sent to us by some North American friends who have lived in Senggigi, Lombok for a couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-senggigi-from-north-america:" tabindex="-1">Getting to Senggigi from North America: <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-to-senggigi-from-north-america:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The airport on our island is called LOP (Lombok Praya). There are a few direct flights from<br>
Singapore, but usually you will have to fly to either Bali or Jakarta and take an internal flight<br>
to get here. There are MANY very cheap flights from Bali and Jakarta, most of them are in<br>
the mornings and early afternoon, so you should try to get to Bali or Jakarta early in the<br>
day.</p>
<p>If you go to a travel site like Kayak and put in LOP as your destination for a flight from the<br>
USA it usually won’t work because it’s just too many connections for the system to figure<br>
out, and most of the tiny, rinky-dink airlines aren’t included in the international travel sites.<br>
The best thing to do is to play around with flights to Jakarta, Bali, or Singapore. Then buy<br>
your connecting ticket from there to us. An okay site for seeing the internal flight options is<br>
<a href="http://Traveloka.com">Traveloka.com</a>. It’s similar to <a href="http://kayak.com">kayak.com</a>, but with an asian focus. If you identify a flight on<br>
Traveloka, you can then choose to go to that airline’s own site to book or book through<br>
Traveloka, or <a href="http://eDreams.com">eDreams.com</a>. The best airline to fly is Garuda, but the Airline group with the<br>
most flights is the Lion Group, it is Lion Air, Air Asia, Wings Air, Batik Air.<br>
Always print out your tickets and boarding passes rather than rely on e-tickets or boarding<br>
passes on your phone. Some of the airlines here dont take e-tickets.</p>
<h2 id="arrival" tabindex="-1">Arrival <a class="direct-link" href="#arrival" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Usually you will fly into Jakarta.<br>
You will need to complete arrival forms. Depending on your flights, you might be able to do<br>
this at your international airport, when you’re about to board your flight there.<br>
Alternatively, while you are waiting for your luggage, go to the machines in the luggage area<br>
and complete your arrival forms. It’s all electronic, you have to answer a bunch of questions<br>
and the machine will show you a QR code. You need to take a PHOTO/screenshot of the QR<br>
code and show it later.</p>
<p>Once you get your luggage you follow the signs for Customs and Immigration. There are<br>
some desks where they check people for COVID vaccine documents. This seems to be<br>
loosely enforced, you might want to just play dumb and try to walk past them to save time.<br>
You need to have a visa to get into the country. Best thing to do is to get the visa ahead of<br>
time online. There is a visa on arrival process/desk you can get the visa when you arrive,<br>
but it can take a while, you will be tired, etc etc.</p>
<h2 id="getting-an-indonesian-tourist-visa" tabindex="-1">Getting an Indonesian tourist visa <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-an-indonesian-tourist-visa" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>You have to pay for the Visa on arrival not sure if they take cards or US dollars. If you get a visa<br>
online bring a printout of it, they might not accept a picture on your phone.<br>
You will also see signs about “registering” your cellphone. It will take forever and cost a<br>
bunch of money. Do NOT do this; see phones below.</p>
<p>Jakarta Airport: You will be spat out basically on the street where taxis and what<br>
not are. If you are continuing on to Lombok, you will need to transfer. International<br>
flights come into Terminal 3. If your connecting flight goes out of Terminal 3 (i.e. on<br>
Garuda airline), you just need to go upstairs to get into the departure area of the<br>
airport. Signage is vague but poke around to find the elevator or ask someone how<br>
to get up there.</p>
<p>If you are on the cheapo airlines you will need to go to Terminal 2 or Terminal 1. It is<br>
a long way, you must find the “Sky Train” to get over to the other terminals. Don’t<br>
try and walk, that doesn’t seem possible. You want the “Sky Train” NOT the subway<br>
or commuter train into the city center.</p>
<p>Bali Airport: If you go into Bali you will take a wined-y route with your luggage and<br>
emerge onto the street. You will either need to check in in the same terminal or,<br>
more likely, walk to the terminal next door for local airlines. Turn left. It’s a 5-10<br>
min walk. Follow the road as it veers to the left. The signs are poor. Ask someone<br>
for reassurance. You can just tell them your airline name and they’ll point you in the<br>
right direction. Don’t get in a taxi to go between terminals. After you’ve passed<br>
through security, you’re in a nice terminal with good food options and shopping. On<br>
the left is a shop that sells Eiger products (bags and camping equipment) which are<br>
decent quality for a lowish price (compared with US brands).</p>
<h2 id="phones" tabindex="-1">Phones <a class="direct-link" href="#phones" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Everyone, including businesses in Indonesia uses Whats App, you will see numbers posted<br>
for businesses that say “WA”. Many businesses don’t even have regular phone numbers, just<br>
Whats App. Download and install WA before you leave and test it out</p>
<p>Like most everywhere, a USA phone will work in Indonesia if you have a roaming plan. You<br>
MUST have a data plan since WA runs over data.<br>
If you try to use a phone that was not purchased in Indonesia with an Indonesian SIM card,<br>
it will work fine for 90 days and then get detected as illegal unless you pay a large tax (several hundred dollars) to the Indonesian government (and they will unlock<br>
it for use in-country). Dealing with the tax authorities takes hours, is really complicated,<br>
and the price will be very high if you have a fancy phone. It can be $400 or more. It is not<br>
worth it.</p>
<p>There are 3 cellphone carriers in Indonesia:<br>
Telkomsel<br>
SmartFren<br>
XL</p>
<p>All three work on Lombok, but we have noticed that in more remote provinces only<br>
Telkomsel works. Telkomsel is older so if you buy a SIM card get that, if you are traveling to<br>
other parts of Indonesia. Prices seem about the same. Like everything, except booze,<br>
cellphone service is very inexpensive in Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id="grab-and-gojek" tabindex="-1">Grab and Gojek <a class="direct-link" href="#grab-and-gojek" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two services Grab and GoJek that are kind of like super services that support car<br>
service, food delivery, package delivery, and in the case of GoJek a payment service. You<br>
should install and configure both apps before you come here.  To put money on Gojek you can bring cash to an<br>
AlphaMart store. Alpha Mart is like 7-11.<br>
The bank links to Gojek only work for Indonesian banks.<br>
These services are most useful for car travel, basically they are just like Uber. Pay attention<br>
to what you order. The cheapest way to travel is on the back of a scooter or motor cycle.<br>
This is pretty dangerous and uncomfortable its best to take a car. It is very cheap, usually<br>
cheaper than a taxi and you are less likely to get ripped off by the driver taking a weird<br>
route than you will in a Taxi. <br>
For Grab you can sometimes link a credit card to your account so you dont have to fool with<br>
cash. When you book a car you can then decide to either have it go to the credit card or pay<br>
in cash.</p>
<h2 id="taxi" tabindex="-1">Taxi <a class="direct-link" href="#taxi" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The most prevalent Taxi service in Indonesia is called BlueBird. These are in Jakarta, Bali,<br>
and Lombok, probably other places too. They are fairly reputable and in Lombok very<br>
honest. In Bali they are a little shady and might drive you around to run up the meter or<br>
come-up with extra fees. Just pay attention if you use them.</p>
<h2 id="money" tabindex="-1">Money <a class="direct-link" href="#money" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The money in Indonesia is the Rupia called IDR, for Indonesian Rupia. Its a bit confusing<br>
because of the high amounts:<br>
1,000 IDR = 7 us cents<br>
100,000 IDR = $7<br>
1,000,000 IDR = $70<br>
Lots of places in Indonesia dont take credit cards, so you should get a pile of cash as soon<br>
as you can. There are ATM machines in the airport. There are many Indonesian banks.<br>
Your US debit card should work in some of the ATM’s, If you have multiple bank accounts at<br>
different banks bring all your debit cards. It appears to be a bit of crap shoot. Sometimes<br>
your card will work on one bank’s machine but not another. Sometimes the same machine<br>
that gave you money yesterday won't work today. If your card doesn't work, don't panic just<br>
try a different machine. Often there will be 3 or 4 ATMs all from different banks right next to<br>
each other. Or just walk down the street and try again.<br>
They will list the highest amount you can get. Usually it's between 2,000,000 and<br>
3,000,000. We had a problem where we did 2 or 3 withdrawals in a row for the max amount<br>
and his US bank freaked out and thought it was a mistake like the machine had double<br>
charged us. If you are going to use the same machine a couple of times use slightly<br>
different amounts.<br>
The biggest note is 100,000. Sometimes people have trouble making change because they<br>
don't have a lot of money laying around, so try and hoard your change a bit and get some<br>
smaller notes. Pay with a 100,000 note at big stores where they will have change.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-to-bring" tabindex="-1">Stuff to Bring <a class="direct-link" href="#stuff-to-bring" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>It’s very warm here so the coldest you will be is on your international flight over. A single<br>
light, long sleeved fleece will support you.<br>
It rains, A LOT, so definitely bring a good raincoat, with a hood.<br>
We get around on Scooters so bring some long pants, closed toed shoes, and a long sleeve<br>
shirt. Even a minor wipe out on a scooter in flip flops, shorts, and short sleeve shirt can<br>
really mess you up. If you have a lightweight Balaclava bring that so that if you get a nasty<br>
sweaty helmet from a rental place, or Tim, you will have a layer in between your head and<br>
the helmet. If you rent a scooter you usually have to ask for a helmet, but they should have<br>
one, and it should not cost extra. Just like a bike helmet it's critical that the helmet have a<br>
strap that you can cinch down tight. Also try and get one with a plastic face shield that goes<br>
across your face. If you want to be super safe then bring a fancy motorcycle helmet from<br>
the USA. Here in Lombok we have a goto scooter guy who will drop one off and pick it up at<br>
our place and knows us. He rents to us for 40,000 IDR a day, the normal price is 50,000 -<br>
60,000 a day. Less than $5.<br>
Bring a mask, and snorkel if you have one.<br>
Many of the beaches are rocky or have sharp coral, so it's a good idea to bring some kind of<br>
water shoes. Keens work really well. Crocs give less protection, and might wash off in the<br>
surf, but they are easy to slip on and off.<br>
BE CAREFUL in the surf. Around our house there are beautiful sandy beaches, but when you<br>
get out 10 feet from shore there are sharp rocks or coral heads sticking up. The local people<br>
assume you know this and might not warn you. If you run down to the water and just dive<br>
into the waves you could get really hurt.</p>
<h2 id="diving" tabindex="-1">Diving <a class="direct-link" href="#diving" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>If you are into Scuba Diving, or think you want to try it, Indonesia is a good place for it!<br>
There are a bunch of dive shops in our town, and there are some resort areas with excellent<br>
boat and beach diving just a few hours away. The diving and snorkeling right in Senggigi<br>
where we live is not great, but it's a short trip to clear calm water.<br>
You must be certified to dive safely. You can find some sleazy operators who will take you<br>
without certification, but that's pretty dangerous so don't do it.</p>
<p>Blue Whales<br>
<a href="https://www.nilatanzil.com/blue-whales-in-komodo-national-park/">https://www.nilatanzil.com/blue-whales-in-komodo-national-park/</a></p>
<p>There are 3 parts of getting certified:<br>
● Bookwork Classroom. Now done online at your own pace.<br>
● Pool exercises where you learn how to use the equipment in shallow, warm, clear<br>
swimming pool<br>
● Openwater checkout. A few dives in the ocean with the instructor.<br>
You could do the bookwork part of getting certified online before you come here, then just<br>
hire a local place to do the in-water part of the certification process. You could also do the<br>
bookwork and pool part in the USA.<br>
Unlike in the US you can get a private instructor and do it really quickly and cheaply here. If<br>
you take a class in the US its usually with a bunch of people and it takes a long time<br>
because the instructor is working with everyone one by one, and there is a lot of waiting<br>
around both on the surface and underwater.<br>
There is a place just 10 minutes up the road with a pool where you can do the pool portion,<br>
then they can take you out in a boat for the checkout dive. If you do this, use PADI that is<br>
by far the most popular agency here and throughout the world.<br>
Go to the PADI website and check it out. You just want the basic package. Dont let them<br>
upsell you on advanced courses, take the classroom part online, and you can do the pool<br>
and checkout dive here quickly with a private instructor.</p>
