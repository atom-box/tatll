<ul>
<li>Chrome Browser popularity peaked five years ago.  But it is still 2/3 of the desktop browser market .  2/3 Chrome, including mobile. 1/10 Safari</li>
<li>Consider fingerprints as the post 3rd party cookie?</li>
<li>Safari and Firefox have blocked 3rd party cookies for a long time</li>
<li>If you're just aiming to track your website's visitors' behaviors, preferences, and basic demographics only while they're on your website, you probably won't be deeply impacted by this change.</li>
<li>Zero party: customer explicitly is giving information</li>
<li>Zero party first coined in 2018 by <a href="http://Forrester.com">Forrester.com</a></li>
<li>Zero party is things they tell you when you ask them: intentions to buy, communication preferences.</li>
<li>First party cookies are all the things they did on your site. Importantly this includes their return and prior visits</li>
<li>First party cookie examples: remembering passwords, basic data about the visitor, and other preferences.</li>
<li>First party: customer is mostly unaware of the collecting</li>
<li>Second party data is B2B. It was collected by that company and the two of you exchange the data for mutual benefit.</li>
<li>Second party: Airline and hotel selling/buying data. Shoe company and clothing company buying and selling data.  Customer doesn't realistically know they are doing this.</li>
<li>Third party data is purchased</li>
<li>Third party brings in: what folks do elsewhere, outside of your site. You should not be asking about that, since they didn't exactly give that permission in any enlightened way.</li>
<li>Third party sends out your message: a retargeting list that can be used to send ads to your past visitors or people with similar web profiles. You stalk people into other places they go.</li>
<li>Third party is like tracer that you allow a martech company to stalk your site visitors with</li>

Google Privacy Sandbox will roll out incrementally late 2022 and all of 2023. Mid 2024 Chrome will not support third party cookies.<br>
The claim is that visitors will be bundled as groups: still reachable as a demographic but not as individuals.<br>
You will still be able to send ads to them, but they will no longer show up at your site volunteering so much information.</p>
