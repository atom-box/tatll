<p>I learned all this at a well-worth-it one week course from Evolving Web.</p>
<p>Before starting to code, the site needs to be planned. Both a redesign or green field development can follow the steps below.  Notice that the actual coding comes pretty late in the sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Questionaires.  Get out of your own head. The closer you get to what your real users are like the more they will enjoy what you build.</li>
<li>Develop fictional personas.
<ul>
<li>a random person who arrived by organic search</li>
<li>a current employee</li>
<li>a volunteer to your org</li>
<li>a job seeker</li>
<li>a potential customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Map ideal journeys those personas would take on your site. What you're paid to do is align what the user feels is a happy experience and what your organization considers a happy experience. Notice we have not written any code yet.</li>
<li>Inventory the existing and potential content.
<ul>
<li>if a competitor site or your org's existing site are relevant you can inventory those. An automatic free tool for building a data tree of site content is at <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/#spider-features">Screaming Frog</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Architect your site. Design the relational database. Make wireframes.</li>
<li>Concept! Let the designers mock up some pages.</li>
<li>Develop. Realize the site in code.</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Several dozen well organized videos are at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXM3Ql1CqDg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXM3Ql1CqDg</a>. They were made in 2016 by Acquia and OS Training.  They are similar (or maybe identical?) to the ones that exist behind the paywall at LinkedIn Learning.</p>
<p>The courses at <a href="https://evolvingweb.ca/training">Evolving Web</a> are worth the money. Their courses are ~$400 for each one week course and they are live, so check the schedule.</p>
