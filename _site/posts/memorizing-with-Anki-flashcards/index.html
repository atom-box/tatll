<p>Anki makes a free studying tool for the desktop. It is a flashcard system for quizzing yourself. You can make a deck of cards or you can obtain pre-made decks online.  Their ideal customer might be doctors and medical students but I downloaded it to help me at work, for learning Matomo web analytics.</p>
<p>Anki's revenue model is that there is a paid version for the Android or iOS phone.</p>
<p>Comparead to Quizlet, a similar app, the studying routine is much more powerful. Anki sorts and analyzes your facility with each card. Your performance statistics are easy to review.</p>

This is an <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy project</a> created from the <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">eleventy-base-blog</a> template.</p>
