<p>12 Takehomes from the New Orleans trip</p>
<h2 id="amtrak" tabindex="-1">Amtrak <a class="direct-link" href="#amtrak" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This was a magical 19 hours.  I would do it again.<br>
We took a sleeper car on the City of New Orleans from Chicago Union Station to Louisiana's New Orleans.  Bring a book, not electronics, to maximize the vibe.</p>
<h2 id="new-orleans-public-library" tabindex="-1">New Orleans Public Library <a class="direct-link" href="#new-orleans-public-library" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Several great artworks were at the central branch.  I worked there for a day.  There are no vending machines, so bring coffee.</p>
<p>Why go: because you want relief from the French Quarter vibe of New Orleans.</p>
<p>Who's there: regular people who need the internet or need a place to quietly hang out.  The space is well used.  I spent a good hour inspecting all of the displays and art.  The central library is an unsung museum, really.</p>
<p>The upscale food court across the street has a great vibe.   <a href="http://www.pythianmarket.com/">http://www.pythianmarket.com/</a>  There's a coffee house, a bar, and several food choices, all in a lively, indoor, open space.  If you have a convention, this would be a decent place to circle up your crew at night if you need to convene a dozen folks.  I think lots of Tulane Medical students are there, so the vibe is youngish.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-day-in-nola" tabindex="-1">My favorite day in Nola <a class="direct-link" href="#my-favorite-day-in-nola" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Rode a public bike (Nola Blue Bikes) out to Treme neighborhood.  Got a haircut at a barber shop Treme .  Then shot across the city on the bike into the Lower Ninth Ward, to finally see what that is all about, 15 years post-Katrina hurricane damage.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-1830s-house-to-stay-in" tabindex="-1">My favorite 1830s house to stay in <a class="direct-link" href="#my-favorite-1830s-house-to-stay-in" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>On Hotwire we got a room in a hotel on Esplanade that still has oil paintings of the LaMothe brother and sister who were the first occupants.  It has a pool! The pool is an unbelieveable feeling when in a hot gritty urban place like this.  30% of the rooms are ancient and wonderful. 30% are newer and comfortable.  Unfortunately 30% are across the street in a less remarkable property, still comfortable and still with pool priveleges.  The location is a 3 minute walk from Frenchmen street, which is a much better alternative for drinking and music than Bourbon or Bergundy streets.</p>
<h2 id="12-years-a-slave" tabindex="-1">12 Years a Slave <a class="direct-link" href="#12-years-a-slave" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The actual tragic scene where Jim Northrop was &quot;sold&quot; (I cannot even believe that is a thing you can do to a father, brother, husband) is right kitty corner from LaMothe House.</p>
<h2 id="eating-cheaper" tabindex="-1">Eating Cheaper <a class="direct-link" href="#eating-cheaper" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Restaurant eating is expensive, even for a divey place.  Shrimp and grits was $20 around here so to stay on something like a budget in New Orleans, the eating near La Mothe is best if you go to the several delicatessans: Verte Mart or a couple others. One is 24 hours, withing two blocks of Jean LaFite House Hotel.  In the map, search &quot;fruit&quot;, &quot;vegetables&quot;, or at least &quot;sandwiches&quot; maybe.</p>
