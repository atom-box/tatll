<p>Kelp seaweed* (bow ties, cut up)<br>
barley<br>
large can of whole tomatoes, cut up with scissors, in pot<br>
TVP (textured vegetable protein, a soy product which Bob's Red Mill makes)<br>

<li>these ingredients are already too salty. Consider soak or rinse of each if you don't want a huge pot of &quot;homemade soup&quot; that just tastes like a can of Campbell's.</li>

<p>Like stone soup, this recipe nucleated around a single ingredient and the need to eat it somehow. We had too much saurkraut and it wouldn't last forever. Meg had made some saurkraut in the fall, from cabbage, and somehow it was both too salty and then it <em>started a second ferment, with yeast, to make alcohol</em>. We decided to arrest its development by putting it in a batch of whatever-soup.</p>
