<p>The website for Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin is at <a href="https://slotkin.house.gov">https://slotkin.house.gov</a>.  The following is what I learned by looking at its web design.</p>
<h2 id="ux" tabindex="-1">UX <a class="direct-link" href="#ux" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The Elissa Slotkin site has a clean design. It seems aware that a third of its users are older folks.</p>
<p>I have an octagenarian friend, so I will investigate the site's senior-friendliness by watching her navigate it this week when she tunes in to the upcoming livestream at <a href="http://slotkin.house.gov/live">http://slotkin.house.gov/live</a></p>
<h2 id="design-and-css" tabindex="-1">Design and CSS <a class="direct-link" href="#design-and-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The use of Red and Blue are very balanced. This is not an blue heavy Squad or E Warren site: keeping the door open to Red and Blue folks.</p>
<h2 id="data-odometer-spinner" tabindex="-1">Data Odometer Spinner <a class="direct-link" href="#data-odometer-spinner" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I don't know what this element is properly termed. It's a banner 2/3 of the way down many popular pages that shows animated loading numbers for how succesful the business is.  For this page, it animates three numbers:</p>
<pre><code>136,000
Responses to Emails, Letters and Calls
2,593
Constituent Cases Closed
$1,637,000
Dollars Returned to Constituents
</code></pre>
<h2 id="technology-used-by-the-site" tabindex="-1">Technology used by the site <a class="direct-link" href="#technology-used-by-the-site" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://builtwith.com/slotkin.house.gov">Built With</a>, the following things are in the stack of the Slotkin site.</p>
<h3 id="varnish" tabindex="-1">Varnish <a class="direct-link" href="#varnish" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Varnish is a server, specialized in caching, maybe for video streaming especially?</p>
<p>2000 of the top 10000 sites use a Varnish server (says Built With).</p>
<p><em>The name Varnish comes from when the instigator of Varnish spent a long time staring at an art-poster with the word &quot;Vernissage&quot; and ended up checking it in a dictionary, which gives the following three meanings of the word...</em> (<a href="https://varnish-cache.org/intro/">https://varnish-cache.org/intro/</a>)</p>
<h3 id="drupal" tabindex="-1">Drupal <a class="direct-link" href="#drupal" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>This continues my observation that there is always a job for you in government web development if you keep up with Drupal.</p>
<p>The site is on an up to date Drupal 9 (yay!).</p>
<p>In theming I see there is a WooTheme style on the FlexSlider.</p>
<h3 id="javascript" tabindex="-1">Javascript <a class="direct-link" href="#javascript" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>FlexSlider (jQuery slider)</li>
<li>SuperFish (jQuery menu)</li>
<li>Hover (<em>hoverIntent is a plug-in that attempts to determine the user's intent by monitoring onMouseOver.</em>)</li>
<li>html5shivhtml5shiv (For Internet Explorer)</li>
<li>Twitter PlatformTwitter (adds a stream of recent tweets)</li>
<li>Facebook for Websites (adds a stream of recent postings)</li>
<li>Facebook SDK (<em>for authentication and sharing via the FB API</em>)</li>
<li>JavaScript SDK enables you to access all of the features of the Graph API via JavaScript, and it provides a rich set of client-side functionality for authentication and sharing. It differs from Facebook Connect.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advertising" tabindex="-1">Advertising <a class="direct-link" href="#advertising" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) (<em>a privacy-preserving mechanism for interest-based ad selection</em>).</p>
<p>It is an ethical advertising project, maybe like DuckDuckGo?  The <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc">Readme at Github</a> is helpful.</p>
<p>The total number of users of FLoC plummeted from 50,000 to 20,000 in August, according to the graph at BuiltWith.</p>
<h3 id="hosting" tabindex="-1">Hosting <a class="direct-link" href="#hosting" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Nexcess<br>
And DNS from Azure maybe</p>
<h3 id="mapping-by-arcgis" tabindex="-1">Mapping by ArcGIS <a class="direct-link" href="#mapping-by-arcgis" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>This seems like a boss-move.  De-google your web pages everybody!</p>
<h3 id="web-analytics" tabindex="-1">Web Analytics <a class="direct-link" href="#web-analytics" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Oh. The Web Analytics is Google Tag Manager.</p>
