<ul>
<li>Loss of education for everyone hurts everyone.</li>
<li>Protecting public schools is a great way to fight extremism.</li>
<li>Loss of education for everyone is an inequality driver.  True: decent schools don't eliminate inequality but eliminating schools will definitely exacerbate inequality.</li>
<li>Phase 1 by the school-voucher-lobby is fund public and private (AZ). Phase 2 is cut one of those at a time and eventually fund neither (my analogy would be: it's like you can't pay your cell carrier bill and you switch to a carrier offering you a lower price, which then expires after 4 months. Maybe now you have no phone at all and you can't switch back: what you had is gone and a salesperson or ad campaign received credit for getting you to switch).</li>
<li>The pandemic, first two years of Biden admin showed the possibilities around poverty elimination.</li>
<li>&quot;Land of equal opportunity&quot; has ever been an unfunded slogan.</li>
<li>Misconception: expecting schools to fight poverty is unrealistic. That high bar, sets them up to be failures, right out of the gate. They do create opportunity.</li>
<li>What AZ is doing to their schools budget is heading them towards a cliff.  The Grover Norquist cliff. The Milton Friedman cliff.</li>

<ul>
<li>Possible cleavage point: Explain clearly that vouchers are not forever and they're not for everywhere nor everyone.</li>
<li>Pointing out that schools have not decreased poverty, is insincere, coming from folks who have no desire to fight poverty.</li>

      <p>This started out just as me seeing how does a JAM stack generate a static site. That was several years ago. This is an <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy project</a> created from the <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog"><code>eleventy-base-blog</code> repo</a></p>
