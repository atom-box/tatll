<h1 id="what's-the-plan" tabindex="-1">What's the Plan <a class="direct-link" href="#what's-the-plan" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1>
<p>The what's-the-plan call happens every week. Leah and Ezra, cofounders of the national Indivisible</p>
<h2 id="year-end-reflection" tabindex="-1">Year end reflection <a class="direct-link" href="#year-end-reflection" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>First time activism, either in yourself or in the people you brought in after the No Kings.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead" tabindex="-1">Looking Ahead <a class="direct-link" href="#looking-ahead" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<h2 id="immigration" tabindex="-1">Immigration <a class="direct-link" href="#immigration" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Protect threatened immigrants.</p>
<h2 id="pillars-of-power" tabindex="-1">Pillars of Power <a class="direct-link" href="#pillars-of-power" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Put the heat on cooperating organizations; make a cost for collaborating on fascism.</p>
<h2 id="2026-election" tabindex="-1">2026 Election <a class="direct-link" href="#2026-election" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This will be an election unlike others.<br>
Preparing for the rigged rules of 2026.<br>
Get in the democrats of renewal.<br>
Win it with mobilizing.<br>
What to do on that day.<br>
How to enforce the results.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-we-back-in-the-2026-primaries" tabindex="-1">Who Should We Back in the 2026 Primaries <a class="direct-link" href="#who-should-we-back-in-the-2026-primaries" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Our lever on the corruption of campaign finance is to choose in the Dem primary who have the right attitude on money in elections.<br>
Scrutinize the funders and scrutinize a candidate's stand on who they allow to donate.<br>
Also, does the candidate support removal of Chuck Schumer from leadership of our party.<br>
This is up to local groups.<br>
#thefightclub<br>
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Chris connecticut: use Indivisible to positively thank folks who join the Fight Club. &quot;The First Rule of Fight Club is to talk about the Fight Club.&quot;  Creed: <em>Do you believe the moment we're in is a crisis?</em></p>
<h2 id="public-lands-question" tabindex="-1">Public Lands question <a class="direct-link" href="#public-lands-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>No good answer from Leah, she admits. *Drive down the regime's capital. Fracture their coalition. Make them unpopular on this issue(and hundreds of issues).  This election is a vote on giving a blank check.</p>
<h2 id="national-die-in-proposed-question" tabindex="-1">National Die-in Proposed question <a class="direct-link" href="#national-die-in-proposed-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>December 10, a fracture of Republicans breaking with Mike Johnson, signing a discharge petition. The math of that makes it likely to pass the House and then hit the known obstructions in the Senate.<br>
Locally? Go for it!  Do it in districts with a vulnerable Republican.<br>
<em>&quot;Republicans promised to fund health care if democrats reopened the government. How's that going?</em></p>
<h2 id="enhance-the-ties-with-peers-question" tabindex="-1">Enhance the ties with peers question <a class="direct-link" href="#enhance-the-ties-with-peers-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Leah says to access the archived training for Solidarity / Building Partners / Building Coalitions.</p>
<h2 id="mass-non-cooperation-if-2026-is-stolen" tabindex="-1">Mass Non-cooperation if 2026 is stolen <a class="direct-link" href="#mass-non-cooperation-if-2026-is-stolen" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>They are likely to try.<br>
Yes, we are very on alert.<br>
e.g.<br>
Republicans are creating new rules right now to affect who votes.<br>
Republicans would deploy the National Guard in blue strongholds.<br>
When they lose, MAGA will kick up enough dust to get blocking actions up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-indivisible-support-starbucks-strike" tabindex="-1">Why Did Indivisible Support Starbucks Strike <a class="direct-link" href="#why-did-indivisible-support-starbucks-strike" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>How do we do intentional work to show we support the people we are bringing in.<br>
We put our capital behind SEIU to show cross group support.  Even though it is not a direct Trump supporter.  Pro workers is pro democracy. Linking that grows the coalition.<br>
The connection can be repaid when we need the union's capability to do a general strike.</p>
