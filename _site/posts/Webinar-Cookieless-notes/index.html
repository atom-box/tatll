<p>In 2023, people talk about cookies going away. What they mean is Chrome, the most common browser, finally solving its use of 3rd party cookies.</p>
<p>Safari and Firefox solved this problem years ago, by blocking third party cookies.</p>
<p>So what is a marketer to do?  Especially an ethical marketer that respects people, privacy?  Or if not, a marketer who wants to be relevant in California and Europe?</p>
<h2 id="sources" tabindex="-1">Sources <a class="direct-link" href="#sources" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>These are notes from Erin, Julian Juenemann, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Remember, these types of cookies are already deprecated in Europe and some browsers.  Soon they will stop working in Chrome.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leverage your 1st Party and Zero Party data<br>
Quizzes and things that people want to explain.   Self profilings on your site that you don't irresponsibly share outside of your legitimate use case.</li>
<li>Track with a randomized fingerprint.</li>
<li>Enable conversion imports in PPC platforms.<br>
PPC - The point is to reduce unnecessary spending and maximize PPC ROI through profitable ad channels.<br>
After an ad view, you want to detect certain &quot;conversions&quot;:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Purchase</li>
<li>Sign-up</li>
<li>Lead (becomes a funnel citizen)</li>
<li>View of a key page</li>
<li>Installs an Application</li>
<li>Calls a phone number (either a dedicated campaign number that is a forwarding virtual number, or detect the &quot;view number&quot; action in your web page)</li>
</ul>
