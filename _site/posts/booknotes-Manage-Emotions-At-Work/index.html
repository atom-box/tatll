<p>We don't like mislabeling. And we may not want to talk about it.   But as a first step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoa, this meeting is getting tense. (group)</li>
<li>That room has a lot of silent faces and cameras are off.  It's not a great vibe.  It's disappointing. (focus on the situation)</li>
<li>That has got to be hard right now. (private, in person)</li>
<li>How do you feel about the plan?</li>
<li>DON'T: You look sad. You sound mad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reframe.<br>
Give an outside perspective. Help your teammate see it in further context.<br>
Be real.<br>
Wait until later.  One to one is warmer for both of you.<br>
DON'T: problem-solve</p>
