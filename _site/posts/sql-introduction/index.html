      <h1>SQL Examples</h1>

<p>Remember these when starting a new LAMP site, such as a Drupal or Symfony project:</p>
<pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE golden_slumbers;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON golden_slumbers.* to 'lennonMcCartney'@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>This is my quick way to describe every table.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME  FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'employees' ;

SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'employees' ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME;
</code></pre>

<p>Functions get applied <em>after</em> the grouping.  So avg(), count(), max(), min(), sum(), all are applied to an entire column usually, except if there is a GROUP BY, they are applied to the group.  It's as if each group is a table of its own and it gets COUNT() locally applied to just it.</p>

<p>My sister works with giant databases.  She says in the real world, these are her quotidian:</p>
<ol>
<li>EXISTS qualifying things without the load of bringing back actual data</li>
<li>NOT EXISTS finds records that dont have a match</li>
<li>IN</li>
<li>GROUP BY is great for getting counts and other aggregate data</li>
</ol>

<p>Robert Half Associates (a recruiter) let me take a SQL test in 2019. Here's a screenshot of my results.</p>
<p>Caveat: I was told to anticipate a generalized test of SQL but a fifth of the questions were specific to the Microsoft SQL server, such as &quot;What is the maximum string length allowed?&quot;. At that time I had never even <em>heard</em> of SQL Server...</p>
<p>In the test score below I have circled the parts that were based on SQL Server.  If you ignore those parts I think this test shows general competency in SQL.</p>

<p>Here are some questions but no db to go with them yet.  I saved the following practice questions for SQL in an old Udacity notebook from 2017 so I'm archiving them here.</p>
<p>Get a list of only orangutangs, sorted by their age.<br>
Get a list of the 5 youngest zebras.<br>
Get a table that lists the nicknames of the animals and how many have that name. So it should show there are 4 Bobs, 4 Fidos, 2 Sammy's, et cetera.<br>
For each species, show the date of birth for the youngest member.<br>
Give just the nicknames of the ferrets, sorted by age, oldest first.<br>
Use Count(), Sum(), and Min().<br>
Give all of the animals, a species at a time, sorted by age.<br>
Add a new cheetah: Pablo, born yesterday.<br>
Find the animals that are non-aquatic and eat fish.</p>
