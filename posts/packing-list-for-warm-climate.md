## Introduction  
The following list is everything I packed for a two week trip to Lombok Indonesia.  
  
This list proved ample. I was missing nothing and received compliments from my fellow travelers as amazingly light and small.  The whole list fit into one gym bag and one student backpack (like a backpack for daily high school attendance).  

## Clothes  
sun hat    
long sleeve pullover, synthetic mesh (a dry-fit undershirt)  
3 pairs of socks  
2 pairs shorts  
1 long pants (wore them on plane, not packed)  
4 short sleeved, button up shirts (1 Trek, 1 black, 1 "microfiber" from 14th Street),   
super thin sunshirt (with hood, pullover style, Outdoor Research)  
2 cotton tshirts (mostly for sleeping, but also for conversation starters)  
1 track jacket (like a soccer warmup)  
1 rain shell (top - but might consider rain pants bottom too if rainier season. But in tropics, getting damp isn't life threatening)  
Keen water type sandles  
very light sneakers  

## Things    
photocopy of the passport  
print out on a sheet of paper of all the flights  
vaccination record including proof of COVID 19 vaccinations  
(a way to check email)  
(set up the public transit and Lyft ride apps for your destination.  For Indonesia, since they don't have Lyft, download the Grab application to your phone)  
A sim card strategy for when you arrive, so you can do ride hail and can access mapping technology, and nowadays: fill out customs forms at the border on your phone, using an in-country SIM card)  
bathing trunks  
snorkel  
mask  
wristwatch (more useful than in normal life)  
2 small mp3 players ($30 style)  
cell phone  
headphones (plugin, not blue tooth)  
charger cables  
charging source (travel style, for Asian / European outlets prongs)  
2 books (one each fiction, non-fiction, the latter with paper for taking notes on the plane)  
(if traveling to non-english country, bring some old books to trade or leave there with coffee houses or hostels common rooms))  
2 magazines (consider 4 next time, some photos oriented, but also long-form journalism)  
6 power bars or nuts  
ibuprofen  
dramamine  
melatonin  
3 pens  
1 pocket journal (the smallest moleskine, for three purposes: exchanging contact info with new friends, jotting names/directions for navigation, journaling a list of daily highlights)  
decongestent  
chewing gum 2 packs  
toothbrush on airplane   
cord for clothesline  
headlamp for plane  
a stack of cash (several hundred USD for 2 weeks in a cheap country)  
the neck pillow for sleeping on plane  
covid n95 masks (3)  
toiletries: bar of soap, deoderant, nail clippers, floss, disinfectent ointment, razor)  
sunglasses  
swim goggles for doing laps if you find a pool: worth it  
knee brace
