## Introduction  
The following list is everything I packed for a two week trip to Lombok Indonesia in 2023. 
  
This list proved ample. I was missing nothing and received compliments from my fellow travelers as amazingly light and small.  The whole list fit into one gym bag and one student backpack (like a backpack for daily high school attendance).  
And there was adequate room for adding purchased souvenicrs later:  6 food items, a new umbrella, wooden clogs, two tea mugs, two moon cade boxes from hosts, tea, two cans of beer a large rock, and two books.  
  
## Clothes  
sun hat    
long sleeve pullover, synthetic mesh (a dry-fit undershirt)  
3 pairs of socks  
4 underwear briefs
2 pairs shorts  
1 long pants (wore them on plane, not packed)  
4 short sleeved, button up shirts (1 Trek, 1 black, 1 "microfiber" from 14th Street),   
super thin sunshirt (with hood, pullover style, Outdoor Research)  
2 cotton tshirts (mostly for sleeping, but also for conversation starters)  
1 track jacket (like a soccer warmup)  
1 rain shell** (top - but might consider rain pants bottom too if rainier season. But in tropics, getting damp isn't life threatening)  
Keen water type sandles (packed) 
very light sneakers (worn, not packed) 

## Things    
print out on a sheet of paper of all the flights !!

(notify credit card you are traveling)  
(set up the public transit and Lyft ride apps for your destination.  For Indonesia, since they don't have Lyft, download the Grab application to your phone)
