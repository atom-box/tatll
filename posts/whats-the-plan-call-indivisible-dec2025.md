# What's the Plan  
The what's-the-plan call happens every week. Leah and Ezra, cofounders of the national Indivisible  

## Year end reflection  
First time activism, either in yourself or in the people you brought in after the No Kings.   

## Looking Ahead  

## Immigration  
Protect threatened immigrants.

## Pillars of Power
Put the heat on cooperating organizations; make a cost for collaborating on fascism. 

## 2026 Election
This will be an election unlike others.
Preparing for the rigged rules of 2026. 
Get in the democrats of renewal.
Win it with mobilizing.
What to do on that day.
How to enforce the results. 

## Who Should We Back in the 2026 Primaries
Our lever on the corruption of campaign finance is to choose in the Dem primary who have the right attitude on money in elections. 
Scrutinize the funders and scrutinize a candidate's stand on who they allow to donate. 
Also, does the candidate support removal of Chuck Schumer from leadership of our party.   
This is up to local groups. 
#thefightclub 
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Chris connecticut: use Indivisible to positively thank folks who join the Fight Club. "The First Rule of Fight Club is to talk about the Fight Club."  Creed: *Do you believe the moment we're in is a crisis?*

## Public Lands question
No good answer from Leah, she admits. *Drive down the regime's capital. Fracture their coalition. Make them unpopular on this issue(and hundreds of issues).  This election is a vote on giving a blank check.  

## National Die-in Proposed question
December 10, a fracture of Republicans breaking with Mike Johnson, signing a discharge petition. The math of that makes it likely to pass the House and then hit the known obstructions in the Senate.  
Locally? Go for it!  Do it in districts with a vulnerable Republican.
*"Republicans promised to fund health care if democrats reopened the government. How's that going?*

## Enhance the ties with peers question 
Leah says to access the archived training for Solidarity / Building Partners / Building Coalitions.

## Mass Non-cooperation if 2026 is stolen
They are likely to try.  
Yes, we are very on alert.  
e.g. 
Republicans are creating new rules right now to affect who votes.
Republicans would deploy the National Guard in blue strongholds.
When they lose, MAGA will kick up enough dust to get blocking actions up to the Supreme Court.  


## Why Did Indivisible Support Starbucks Strike 
How do we do intentional work to show we support the people we are bringing in.
We put our capital behind SEIU to show cross group support.  Even though it is not a direct Trump supporter.  Pro workers is pro democracy. Linking that grows the coalition.  
The connection can be repaid when we need the union's capability to do a general strike.
