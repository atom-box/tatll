## Evan Genest says
I wish I had known about this book when I was a mentor of tenth graders.  Back then I was too focused on teaching chemistry. I could have added this sort of coaching and pep talks and reached a totally different part of my audience.  
  
There's great Growth Mindset tips in this book, concretized. I'm putting all the nuggets here now. Surely I will get a chance to use these in a coaching situation.  
  
Notes:  

## Be Focused 
* If you feel overwhelmed, find one small task to take.
* Dwell on what you want, rather than what worries you.  
* Start with envy.  Envy isn't shameful, it's powerful.  
* Make plans to make progress.  Once you see the path, you can take it.  
* Spend time planning, not worrying or escaping.  
* When you think about what you crave, desire, and wish for -- how do you feel?
  
## Be Hopeful  
* Think of your future self as the child of your current self  
* Just treading water is important work. Don't feel bad if you aren't taking "huge leaps forward".
* Train the voice in your head to give pep talks, not put downs.  Think you're lucky? You will be lucky. (This is a form of gratitude.) XXX
   
##  Be Resourceful
* Every obstacle is a resource. Your current situation contains all of the components of your future success. It's a puzzle you can solve any way you want. The present is like an escape room: People pay to be in these things and then solve the way forward.
* Leverage the riches youu have. 
* Stop asking for chances; start taking them without permission.
* Fear not what others think. Opinions in the world = [infinity symbol]. There are hundreds of thumbs down, terrible reviews of *everything*, even Anne Frank's diary 
* Treasure your nemesis. When you get your awards someday, thank your nemesis. Love is a scary-strong source of strength. Put your energy into waging peace; fear has no traction when love takes the wheel. XXX
* Don't give up before you begin. If the worst that could happen is that you learn something new, why not just go for what you want? XXX
* Keep a go to kit: Your most trussted friend and all their contact information. Your favorite place to be and how to get there.
  
## Be Earnest
* Heroes dare to fix what's busted. Notice -> Ignore -> multiplied problem. Notice -> Fix -> Solved.XXX
* If you don't ask for help, nobody will know you need it. 
* Nobody ever did anything amazing nonchalantly. Anything worth doing is worth doing with an intense and potentially embarrassing amount of energy.  
* Action.

## Be Connected
* Connect with those who share your focus.
* Volunteer to do this. Do it in public. 
* Exile is a form of punishment. And remember, you are the missing piece of someone else's puzzle.
* Sort your surrounders: recognize which people around you speak in helpful terms. XXX
* Put your connecting techniques to work: Compliment others 2x as much as you think you should. Be welcoming, not gate keeping whenever you meet anyone new. 
* Invite as many people to as many things as possible.  

## Be Aware
* Check in with yourself often. 
* Give everyone more credit. The iceberg of obliviousness: what we see/what's really going on with them.
* Ask yourself why you spend your time the way you do. Avoiding your destiny often looks like a schedule full of nothing of importance. 
* Doing fewer things means doing bigger things.
