## Udemy: Complete Communication Skills
A gigantic course cobbled together from TJ Walker's two hundred mini videos. These are notes I took while listening to TJ talking about talking.    

## All communication  
All communication should be judged by what do your listeners retain and do they then do something.  
Your goal is to be memorable and to have a call to action.  


## Powerpoint 
His preference: don't.  
If you must: one idea per slide as an anchor to your talk.    
Or consider: just an image per slide, nothing else.  

## Introducing yourself
Remember, your goal is to be memorable and to have a call to action.  
Don't say name/job/company at beginning.   
Do:
1 - start by posing a problem they can relate to. 
2 - then say your name 
3 - incentivize them to interact with you later, with a freebie or an intrigue of mystery  
4 - 30 seconds maximum 

## Notes  
One sheet: it's a bad speech if you can't talk from a single sheet. 
No levels of indenting or hierarchy.  
Your triggering your stories.
Remember you should only be making 5, 3, or even 2 points. Studies show that nobody will hang onto it otherwise. In which case, why did you even talk?

## Content 
Describe a real problem.  
Relate a real conversation about that.  
Emphasize how you all felt. 
Solve the problem.   

## Persuasion  
Know the finish line.  
It's a numbers game. Aim for 75% failure.     
Improve a little bit each time: always be getting 2% better. It adds up. But to do that you need a feedback mechanism, a reflective practice.
10,000 hours rule.
