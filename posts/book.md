## The Idea  
We could try reading one short story from The Penguin Book of the Modern American Short Story.  

For example, we could read the short story by Raymond Carver. 

## The Day
Would any of these days work:
December 20, 21, 26, 27?
  
If you want to put in a time that works for you, here's a doodle poll for available time at [Crab Fit](https://crab.fit/gang-penguinshortstories-book-club-384763)

## Where    
The meeting platform opens in any web browser. It is a free, opensource, encrypted platform called Brave Talk.
