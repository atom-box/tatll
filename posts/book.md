Maybe just put ~3 or so, to make the list easier to vote on later. The board will be editable, so you can delete and change until the deadline.  
  
## Next Meeting: March 16, 2025   
__Time__ Netherlands: 7pm**, Detroit: 2pm, Chicago: 1pm, Pacific: 11am
Final encounter with The Penguin Book of Modern American Short Stories  :  
1. The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas by Ursula K Le Guin
2. Your choice: read any other story from the Penguin BoMASS and come prepared to share your recommendation/disrecommendation of it. 
  
**This new time is because [the US changed its clocks](https://24timezones.com/difference/detroit/amsterdam) this month to Daylight Savings Time. 

## Voting for books  
* Deadline to __submit__ titles is March 16.
  
* When we gather on March 16 we can __tell a little__ about the titles we submitted, to help folks decide which to vote for.  
  
* Between March 16 and March 22 __vote for some books__. Starting March 16, if you go to where you submitted your titles, there will be thumbs up icons. Each person gets 12 thumbs-up votes that they can distribute in any way they wish, for example a single dot each to twelve books, or 6 + 6 dots given to two books, or lay all 12 dots on one book. (thumb = dot) üëçüèº      
Deadline to finish voting is March 22.
