## What  
We are reading a short story per month from The Penguin Book of the Modern American Short Story.  

If you want to try this, our first meeting could be to discuss the short story by Raymond Carver. 

## Day
Would any of these days work:
December 20, 21, 26, 27?
  
I made a doodle poll for available time at [Crab Fit](https://crab.fit/gang-penguinshortstories-book-club-384763)
