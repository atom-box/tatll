## Et cetera
  
This micro-book-club meets once per month. To save time, we don't discuss books, we discuss short stories. Please read one or both of the short stories for that month and then come to the online call to discuss them.  
  
It's private: friends and friends of friends. I encourage you to invite anyone who you think will enjoy it. To invite them, simply share the link to this page.
