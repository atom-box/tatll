# What's the Plan  
The what's-the-plan call happens every week. Leah and Ezra, cofounders of the national Indivisible are on a live webinar every week. Find it on mobilize.us and rsvp.  It's heartening to see all the people signing in and chatting.    
  
# Notes from September 25, 2025   
Opening welcomes: two new Utah indivisible groups, and a high school group.  College groups are plentiful but high school group is noteworthy.   
  
## Feel great about this Kimmel victory  
Encouraging: Robert Reich, et al sense a tipping point. Leah Greenberg not so much: like an athlete who scored a point, regroup, stay calm, stay in formation. And prepare for setbacks and being a point down.  In other words try to vibe the Kimmel victory as fuel to get you through future hard times. Fuel recruiting and messaging with the Kimmel victory.     
  
## What if Trump tries to shut down Indivisible    
Trump makes a lot of threats against a lot of people.  Are you really shaken when the eye of Sauron (my words) gaze upon you?  Show up on October 18.  If Leah and Ezra were somehow sequestered or silenced, there are still 1000s of NoKings small groups.    
  
## Tangerineking is crying "antifa" as a new national scapegoat  
It makes it scarier to come out and publicly show yourself in the streetcorners. So, what to do? Comply in advance? faced with a baseless lawsuit, ABC tv chose to comply, which emboldened the power and precedent of shaking down tv stations. Faced with being called "antifa" don't slow down: keep organizing, keep marching, and emphasize nonviolence.  By the way, ActBlue is a counterexample: they stared down the orangeman and are still standing as strong as ever.    
  
Again: very important to stay non violent.  
  
## Boycotts    
Works at Target, Disney+.  Doesn't work at Sinclair maybe.    
  
## Schumer, government shut down  
Democrats have improved: this time they drew a line in the sand. ACA, Medicare restore, an end to recisions nonsense as the line in the sand.  
Unfortunately, leaders are followers. So we have to lead the Gillibrand senators in this.  

## Attract young people to Indivisible  
"Protect our democracy, protect our existing system" - not a frame that works with young people.  They start from feeling that the system has failed them.  
Serve pizza to attract Gen Z, offer childcare to attract millenials.  "Childcare is the 'pizza' of older people."
