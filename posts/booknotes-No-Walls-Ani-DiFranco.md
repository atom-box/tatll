No Walls and the Recurring Dream  
by Ani Di Franco  

##  The Book

It's a great book. Very in tone with the rest of her work.  

This gives more space for you to hear the hard luck stories, the idealism, and the very brave road tripping.    

## The Songs

These are the titles of the nine songs she gives the lyrics to:  

Self Evident    
The Slant  
My IQ  
Grand Canyon  
Grey  
Subdivision  
Platforms  
Akimbo  
Imagine That  


## For more music

If all you have of Ani is an old cassette of Living in Clip there is a lot more and she is very busy still.   You can listen for free at Bandcamp. And also purchase there.
