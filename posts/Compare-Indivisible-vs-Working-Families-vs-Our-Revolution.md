```
What were the periods of greatest vigor for Indivisible? How 
effective is it now?
```

### **Periods of Greatest Vigor ‚Äì Indivisible**

Indivisible surged into prominence in response to Donald Trump‚Äôs election in 2016. Its **greatest period of energy and influence** can be divided into two main phases:

---

### üü© **1. Formation and Early Action (Late 2016 ‚Äì Mid 2017)**

* **Catalyst:** The publication of *The Indivisible Guide* in December 2016‚Äîa 26-page Google Doc written by former congressional staffers.
* **Rapid Mobilization:** Within weeks:

  * The guide went viral (millions of views/downloads).
  * Thousands of local chapters formed organically.
* **Tactics:** Modeled on the Tea Party‚Äôs tactics‚Äîlocal pressure on members of Congress through town halls, protests, and calls.
* **Impact:**

  * Instrumental in flooding congressional offices with constituent calls.
  * Credited with helping to defeat Trump‚Äôs 2017 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

---

### üü¶ **2. 2018 Midterms Mobilization (Late 2017 ‚Äì November 2018)**

* **Focus:** Electing a Democratic majority in the House to check Trump‚Äôs power.
* **Success:**

  * Democrats won **41 seats** in the House, flipping control.
  * Indivisible groups were central to voter outreach, canvassing, and phone banking.
* **Peak Infrastructure:** Over 6,000 affiliated groups, many holding regular meetings and direct actions.

---

### ‚ö™Ô∏è **Post-2018 to Present (2019‚Äì2025): A Gradual Decline with Refocusing**

**2019‚Äì2020:**

* Still active in opposing Trump‚Äôs agenda and supporting impeachment.
* Played a role in **mobilizing for the 2020 election**, backing Biden and Senate flips in Georgia.

**2021‚Äì2022:**

* With Democrats in power, focus shifted to **pushing progressive policies** (e.g., the Build Back Better Act).
* Less momentum than in opposition; internal tensions around Democratic Party tactics.

**2023‚Äì2025:**

* **Lower visibility** nationally.
* Still maintains an email list, fundraising, and issues calls to action, but much of the grassroots activity has faded or been absorbed into other movements (e.g., climate, abortion rights, local activism).
* Some groups continue as **local progressive clubs**, but not always under the "Indivisible" name.

---

### **How Effective Is Indivisible Now? (As of 2025)**

**Effectiveness: Moderate to Low**

* **National presence:** Diminished.

  * The central Indivisible Project still exists and issues policy scorecards, endorsements, and fundraising appeals.
* **Local chapters:** Many disbanded or dormant.

  * Some still active but focused more on hyperlocal elections and issues.
* **Compared to 2017‚Äì2018:** Now more like a **progressive infrastructure hub** than a mass mobilization force.

---

### **Bottom Line**

* **Most vigorous:** 2017‚Äì2018, when it helped flip the House and block Trump‚Äôs agenda.
* **Now:** Still present but not a major mobilizing force. Its influence has waned, though it laid the groundwork for sustained local activism and future progressive organizing models.

### üü® Strengths of 5Calls.org:

---

### üü• Limitations Compared to Indivisible and Others:

* **No endorsements, campaigns, or staff structure.**
* **Little media presence or public-facing leadership**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Best Way to Think of 5Calls.org**

It's like a **Swiss Army knife for phone activism**:

---

### üß† Bottom Line:

* **5Calls.org** is more **agile** than Indivisible but **less influential** in terms of shaping elections or public narratives.
* Still **very useful** and alive in 2025 ‚Äî but works **best in coordination** with larger groups (like Indivisible, MoveOn, etc.).

How about Our Revolution?
```

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Ideology**               | Boldly left-progressive, Bernie-aligned                | Broadly liberal-progressive           |
| **Membership**             | \~1 million claimed supporters (2024)                  | 500k‚Äì750k (email/action participants) |
| **Local Chapters**         | \~600‚Äì700 local chapters                               | 6,000+ at peak, now far fewer active  |
| **Political Endorsements** | Hundreds per cycle, from city council to Congress      | Fewer, often tied to national agenda  |
| **Electoral Focus**        | Yes ‚Äî candidate recruitment, endorsements, campaigning | Some, but more pressure-based         |
| **Ties to Institutions**   | Strong with labor, DSA, Bernie-aligned groups          | Moderate; more independent grassroots |
| **Activity in 2025**       | **Active and visible**, especially in primaries        | Active but lower visibility           |

---

## üü® **Strengths of Our Revolution**

* **Candidate Pipeline:** Has helped launch careers of elected officials like Rashida Tlaib, Jamaal Bowman, and Summer Lee.
* **Labor and Working-Class Focus:** Unique among major progressive groups for emphasizing **union organizing** and **anti-corporate policy**.
* **State and Local Power:** Focus on school boards, statehouses, and utility boards‚Äînot just Congress.

---

## üü• **Weaknesses**

* **Factional Perception:** Tied closely to the Bernie wing of the party, sometimes limiting broader coalition appeal.
* **Internal Struggles:** Experienced leadership turnover and messaging inconsistencies.
* **Less Grassroots Autonomy:** More top-down than Indivisible's early structure, with chapters often dependent on central leadership.

---

**More Effective Than Indivisible in 2025?**
‚û°Ô∏è **Yes**, in terms of:

* **Electoral impact**
* **Policy pressure**

‚û°Ô∏è **No**, in terms of:

---

### ‚úÖ Ideal For You If:

* You want to **elect progressive candidates**, especially in **primaries**.
