## What is Anki
Anki makes a free studying tool for the desktop. It is a flashcard system for quizzing yourself. You can make a deck of cards or you can obtain pre-made decks online.  Their ideal customer might be doctors and medical students but I downloaded it to help me at work, for learning Matomo web analytics.

Anki's revenue model is that there is a paid version for the Android or iOS phone. 

Comparead to Quizlet, a similar app, the studying routine is much more powerful. Anki sorts and analyzes your facility with each card. Your performance statistics are easy to review.
