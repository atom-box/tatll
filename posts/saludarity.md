# Banana Madison

Banana Madison is a weekly action group building people-powered resistance to authoritarianism.

## The meetup

Our group meets once a week to plan, learn, and take action together. We’re creating a space to turn our anger, fear, and frustration into focused work that makes a real difference. We:

1. Share stories of what we have done so far
2. Brainstorm next possible actions to do, based on news of the week. We have to stay sustainable, so the actions can be small and frequent or large and infrequent.

We draw on the tools and methods from Pramila Jayapal’s *Resistance Lab* and the energy of Indivisible.org’s No Kings Movement. We are using a proven playbook from other successful national movements to stand up against authoritarianism.

Democracies can fall in a matter of months, which makes this an immediate and urgent moment—so we’re coming together now to strengthen our capacity to resist.

## Theory of action

### Surface area

An authoritarian has a small primary surface area but a large, soft secondary surface area. They historically have thrived only when key groups—like media, churches, businesses, universities, and government workers—continued to support them. Organized actions such as picketing, chalking messages, street theater, public dance parties, hashtag campaigns, funny memes, and holding home meetings all weaken those pillars.

### Conversations

We work to gently move people one step at a time away from helping the authoritarian, whether they’re MAGA voters, conservatives, non-voters, liberals, or active resisters. Thoughtful, respectful conversation is a realistic way that can move someone one step along that continuum.
