# Name:   
Saludarity  
 
    
# Two equally important co-purposes.  
  
# Purpose 1:   
Nonviolent, pro-democracy actions in the mold of indivisible.org     
Yes: 
picketing Tesla  
No: 
picketing a data center  
Above example explained: 
Elon Musk is directly involved collapsing of public institutions, a main goal of anti-democracy groups. The environmental harm and AI-controversy of a data center is only tangentially connected to the collapse of democracy.  
  
# Purpose 2:   
Have fun.  
  
# # More details:   
* __Non-violence__.  
* __How to do Purpose 1__: Our actions are both to enact a hundred ways to say no act on the pillars-of-power theory AND to move groups to an adjacent group along the five stage activist-against-authoritarianism - MAGA line.  
* __How to do Purpose 2__: Self explanatory.   See each other - have fun. Feel hopeful. Supportive group.
