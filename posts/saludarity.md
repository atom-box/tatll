# Salud-arity

We were formed in 2025 as a weekly brainstorming, group motivating each other to say no, building people-powered resistance to authoritarianism. We meet every Wednesday at 7pm at Garth's Brew Bar in Madison Wisconsin, one block north of Trader Joe's. 


## Our meetup

Our group meets once a week to plan, learn, and take action together. We’re creating a space to turn our anger, fear, and frustration into focused work that makes a real difference. w the meeting goes:

1. We check in, each introducing ourselves and sharing recent stories of what we have done to say No to the administration 
2. We brainstorm next possible actions to do, based on news of the week. We have to stay sustainable, so the actions can be small and frequent or large and infrequent.


## Action: Say No
Everything we do is intended to say No to this administration. 

The cancelling, and reinstatement of the Jimmy Kimmel Show is an example of this approach. 



## Details

Every Wednesday at [Garth's Brew Bar](https://www.garthsbrewbar.com/) 1726 Monroe Street, Madison Wisconsin 53711

## Theory of action

### Surface area

An authoritarian has a small primary surface area but a large, soft secondary surface area. They historically have thrived only when key groups—like media, churches, businesses, universities, and government workers—continued to support them. Organized actions such as picketing, chalking messages, street theater, public dance parties, hashtag campaigns, funny memes, and holding home meetings all weaken those pillars.

### Conversations
Talking to strangers and friends is a direct action.  
  
We work to gently move people one step at a time away from helping the authoritarian, whether they’re MAGA voters, conservatives, non-voters, liberals, or active resisters. Thoughtful, respectful conversation is a realistic way that can move someone one step along that continuum.



### Theory

Democracies can fall in a matter of months, which makes this an immediate and urgent moment—so we’re coming together now to strengthen our capacity to resist.  No Kings and Hands Off events are important starting points. We aim to take the next steps after No Kings.  


## How to join

We have a Signal group chat.  Nothing else.  


## Are We An Indivisible group?
Not now.  Some of us belong to Indivisible Madison East or Indivisible Near West Madison. We agree to Indivisible's principles:   
 
- All events and actions will be nonviolent. Our signs are chalk and tape, not wheatpaste nor paint.  We do not destroy private or public property. 
- We are here to remake our democracy. We recognize our democracy was rigged from the start in favor of the white and wealthy. We actively work to realize a shared vision of a real democracy — of, by, and for the people.
- We are not a party but we will promote candidates and solicit their support of our values. 
- We model inclusion, respect, and fairness in all of our actions. 
- We partner with Indivisible and other anti-authoritarian, pro-democracy groups on advocacy, elections, and national Indivisible campaigns.
- We build a strong and strategic movement. We focus our efforts to maximize our impact, winning progressive policy victories and taking power at the local, state, and federal level.



## Staying focused
Focus: our actions are ways to push back on authoritarianism.    

Here are some examples and counterexamples.
