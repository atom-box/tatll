# Theory:   
1. Five sentiment stage   
movement along poles from Authoritarian to anti-authoritarian  
2. Theory of The Dictator's public pillars of surface area  

## More details:   
* __Non-violence__.  
* __How to do Purpose 1__: Our actions are both to enact a hundred ways to say no act on the pillars-of-power theory AND to move groups to an adjacent group along the five stage activist-against-authoritarianism - MAGA line.  
* __How to do Purpose 2__: Self explanatory.   See each other - have fun. Feel hopeful. Supportive group.   

## Further details  
__Yes__:   
picketing Tesla    
__No__:   
picketing a data center    
__Above example explained__:   
Elon Musk is directly involved collapsing of public institutions, a main goal of anti-democracy groups. The environmental harm and AI-controversy of a data center is only tangentially connected to the collapse of democracy.    
__Yes__
Call party to get friends to call Tammy Baldwin to thank her or encourage her to do something we want  
__No__ 
Canvassing or supporting a candidate (plenty of us can join existing canvassing groups)  
  
  
Carl says:   
People need to want to join even if not a zealot now.   
  
# Problem:  
- how to make the group not a bunch of linux admins white men  
- recruiting from the couch; "it's really easy to get bummed out about politics" , "theyre all the same",
