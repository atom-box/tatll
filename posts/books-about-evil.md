*Brainstorming, I asked Open AI what are some books similar to MacBeth or Crime and Punishment.* 

### Some Books  
Here are **novels from the last 100 years** that seriously engage with the theme of **evil** and would pair well with *Macbeth*, *Crime and Punishment*, and *The Trial* in a college course on **good and evil**:

---

### 1. **_The Master and Margarita_ by Mikhail Bulgakov (1940, published posthumously in 1967)**
- **Why it fits**: The Devil comes to Soviet Moscow, exposing hypocrisy and corruption. It mixes satire, theology, and metaphysics, questioning the nature of good and evil in a godless society.
- **Thematic resonance**: The Devil is not merely malevolent — he’s a force of moral and metaphysical reckoning.
- **Why it’s taught**: Deep philosophical themes, subversion of authoritarian regimes, and literary experimentation. Often compared to *The Trial* and *Faust*.

---

### 2. **_Blindness_ by José Saramago (1995)**
- **Why it fits**: A plague of blindness hits a city, and society collapses into chaos, cruelty, and power struggles. It's an allegory of moral degeneration and human savagery.
- **Thematic resonance**: Evil isn’t supernatural — it’s what people become when rules disappear.
- **Why it’s taught**: Frequently appears in modern literature, ethics, and political philosophy courses.

### 3. **_Disgrace_ by J.M. Coetzee (1999)**
- **Why it fits**: In post-apartheid South Africa, a disgraced professor and his daughter experience violence that challenges their beliefs about justice, guilt, and atonement.
- **Thematic resonance**: Evil as embedded in social structures and personal actions. Ethical ambiguity is central.
- **Why it’s taught**: A major work in postcolonial and moral philosophy contexts.

---

### 4. **_Blood Meridian_ by Cormac McCarthy (1985)**
- **Why it fits**: A brutal Western epic where violence is elemental and the character of Judge Holden is a chilling, almost mythic embodiment of philosophical evil.
- **Thematic resonance**: Evil as cosmic, amoral force. Deeply Nietzschean.
- **Why it’s taught**: Often compared to *Macbeth* in its treatment of fate, violence, and moral nihilism.

---

### 5. **_The Painted Bird_ by Jerzy Kosiński (1965)**
- **Why it fits**: A harrowing story of a boy wandering through Eastern Europe during WWII, encountering cruelty and depravity at every turn.
- **Thematic resonance**: Evil as dehumanization, often seen in war and trauma literature.
- **Why it’s taught**: It’s extreme, controversial, and morally unsettling — ideal for courses wrestling with the boundaries of evil.

If you're looking for something both **philosophically rigorous** and **literarily rich**, **_The Master and Margarita_** or **_Blood Meridian_** are top choices.  
If you're more interested in **societal evil and moral ambiguity**, **_Disgrace_** and **_Blindness_** are compelling modern options.
