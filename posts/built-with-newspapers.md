## Introduction  
I used [Builtwith](https://builtwith.com) to check the tracking and web analytics used by several large circulation newspapers.  
  
  
This is not a careful list yet. It jumbles the good and the bad.  

This list includes the innocent:
- internal data analytics tools that don't sell to anybody (e.g. Matomo.org)  
  
as well as the profiteers:
- internal tools that are "free" and re-sell without emphasizing that is their business model and whitewash their business model by telling you how to "adjust your privacy settings" (Google)
- full-blown PII re-sellers that make no bones about what their incentive is

## Martech 5000
Part of my interest is to check the media's participation in the Martech 5000 ecosystem.

## Analysis
The European media use fewer Marketing Technologies.  Le Monde is especially low Martech/high Privacy.  
<br/>
Among the American media, the smaller the site traffic, the more ad revenue they seem to be trying to squeeze out of their platform.
