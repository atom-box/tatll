## Disappointing series:

Drupalize.me.  Highly advertised. Not worth the paywall, that's for sure.  It feels like a wrapper someone made around the official docs.  Their #UI is a little busy; confusing navigation.

## Good series:

These have all been worth the effort and cost:

- The Ryan Weaver Drupal videos at [Symfonycasts](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/drupal8-under-the-hood). For developers writing OOP Symfony, emphasizing correct dependency injection for the classes of PHP. Output of the pages is all with Symfony Twig. There is no use of the Drupal GUI. This was my gateway tutorial that got me excited to go look up Drupal CMS in the first place.
- [Evolving Web]() Live instruction, peer to peer breakout rooms with classmates. Build your own track, starting in the fall and finishing in the spring. About CA$450 per week.
- [WebWash](https://www.webwash.net/getting-started-with-bootstrap-4-using-radix-in-drupal/) courses. By Ivana Zugec.  Dozens of great Drupal videos.
- [Talking Drupal](https://talkingdrupal.com/).  This is a weekly podcast but it is as good as taking a course. The hosts banter about their personal lives at the start of each course but, skipping that, the podcast is essentially 300+ lessons in Drupal with APIs, JSON, deployment.  Occasional long interviews too, with the creator of Drupal, Dries Buytaert.
- Forty short videos from [Acquia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpVC00PAQQxHi-llE9Z8-Q747NYWpsq6t).
- [Level Up](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/drupal-8-basics/our-first-blog-post) course, by Scott Tolinski
- The actual [docs](https://www.drupal.org/). They are emergent, sprawling, well-written, but very much "open source". The official documentation is a series of loosely linked pages written over many years, and pulled into the vast archipelago at Drupal.org
