The single easiest way for you to improve the impression you make in your emails is to apply the rules of Plain Writing. No matter what you think your current writing ability is, you can always go from Point A -> PointB.  
  
Check yourself against the US National Archives [Plain Language checklist](https://www.archives.gov/open/plain-writing/10-principles.html).  

Here are the results of me checking myself:  

 
## Four rules I'm already following  
* Use headings, lists, and tables to make reading easier.
* Use everyday words. If you must use technical terms, explain them on the first reference.
* Omit unneeded words.
* Limit each paragraph to one idea and keep it short.
## First three things I need to start doing
* Write in active voice. Use the passive voice only in rare cases.
* Write for your reader, not yourself.
* State your major point(s) first before going into details.
## Next four things I need to start doing
* Keep the subject and verb close together.
* Use short sentences as much as possible.
* Stick to your topic.
* Proofread your work, and have a colleague proof it as well.
## I want to push back against this rule    
* Use pronouns when you can.  
  
Anybody know why this is a thing? 

I always tried the opposite. I always tried to use *fewer* pronouns in technical things.
