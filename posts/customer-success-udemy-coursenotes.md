## Udemy as a resource 
Seeking training in Customer Success, I found little at Udemy at first. Finally I found five. Using the "preview a lecture for free" I winnowed the five down to two, and finally I am now watching/listening to Gustavo Escobar Henriquez.   
  
## Mobile  
It's nice to get Udemy as the phone app.  My employer, Matomo, is paying for this course as part of a corporate bundle they purchased.  Therefore I was careful to choose the second of two Udemy apps in the iPhone store. The correct app in this case is Udemy for Business
