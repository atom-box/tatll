## First: Acknowledge
We don't like mislabeling. And we may not want to talk about it.   But as a first step:  
* Whoa, this meeting is getting tense. (group)
* That room has a lot of silent faces and cameras are off.  It's not a great vibe.  It's disappointing. (focus on the situation)
* That has got to be hard right now. (private, in person)
* How do you feel about the plan? 
* DON'T: You look sad. You sound mad.

## Then: if permitted
Reframe.  
Give an outside perspective. Help your teammate see it in further context. 
Be real.  
Wait until later.  One to one is warmer for both of you.  
DON'T: problem-solve
