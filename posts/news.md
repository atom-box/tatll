## Pillars  
Most of the power of an authoritarian state is freely given.  
  
A principle tactic against authoritarians is to analyze the supporting pillars.  All authoritarians operate with the support of their people, who in turn allow the pillars to support the authoritarian. The high surface area of the pillars is exciting to me, because that area suggests all kinds of ways that folks have power, plain old folks, like me (Evan). Right now I think the job is to raise awareness of Indivisible groups and similar groups, including well-practiced ones like Voces de la Frontera.   Help educate people to transition from "protests don't solve anything", towards the pillars concept.
