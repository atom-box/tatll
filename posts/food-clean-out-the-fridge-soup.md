## Ingredients
Kelp seaweed* (bow ties, cut up)
barley
large can of whole tomatoes, cut up with scissors, in pot
TVP (textured vegetable protein, a soy product which Bob's Red Mill makes)
saurkraut and brine *
potatoes
fennel heads
cinnamon 
chili powder
ground ginger
olive oil (2 Tablespoons)(gets absorbed by the TVP)
sesame oil (teaspoon)
Worchestershire Sauce (1 Tablespoon)

* these ingredients are already too salty. Consider soak or rinse of each if you don't want a huge pot of "homemade soup" that just tastes like a can of Campbell's.

## Steps
1. Barley, seaweed boil in some water, not too much, for 30 minutes.
2. Add other ingredients and simmer an additional 20 minutes

Server with Bittman Bread

## Origin 
Like stone soup, this recipe nucleated around a single ingredient and the need to eat it somehow. We had too much saurkraut and it wouldn't last forever. Meg had made some saurkraut in the fall, from cabbage, and somehow it was both too salty and then it *started a second ferment, with yeast, to make alcohol*. We decided to arrest its development by putting it in a batch of whatever-soup.
