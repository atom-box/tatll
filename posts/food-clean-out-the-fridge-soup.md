Like stone soup, this nucleated around a single ingredient and the need to eat it somehow. Meg had made some saurkraut in the fall, from cabbage, and somehow it was both too salty and then it started a second ferment, with yeast, to make alcohol. We decided to arrest its development by cleaning out the cupboards with this batch of whatever-soup.

## Ingredients
Kelp seaweed* (bow ties, cut up)
barley
large can of whole tomatoes, cut up with scissors, in pot
TVP (textured vegetable protein, a soy product which Bob's Red Mill makes)
saurkraut and brine *
potatoes
fennel heads
cinnamon 
chili powder
ground ginger
olive oil (2 Tablespoons)(gets absorbed by the TVP)
sesame oil (teaspoon)
Worchestershire Sauce (1 Tablespoon)



* these ingredients made it salty from the get go. Recommend rinsing if you don't want a huge pot of homemade soup that just tastes like a can of Campbell's.

## Steps
1. Barley, seaweed boil in some water, not too much, for 30 minutes.
2. Add other ingredients and simmer an additional 20 minutes
