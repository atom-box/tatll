12 Takehomes from the New Orleans trip  

##  Amtrak  
This was a magical 19 hours.  I would do it again.  
We took a sleeper car on the City of New Orleans from Chicago Union Station to Louisiana's New Orleans.  Bring a book, not electronics, to maximize the vibe.  

## New Orleans Public Library  
Several great artworks were at the central branch.  I worked there for a day.  There are no vending machines, so bring coffee.  

Why go: because you want relief from the French Quarter vibe of New Orleans.  

Who's there: regular people who need the internet or need a place to quietly hang out.  The space is well used.  I spent a good hour inspecting all of the displays and art.  The central library is an unsung museum, really.  

The upscale food court across the street has a great vibe.   http://www.pythianmarket.com/  There's a coffee house, a bar, and several food choices, all in a lively, indoor, open space.  If you have a convention, this would be a decent place to circle up your crew at night if you need to convene a dozen folks.  I think lots of Tulane Medical students are there, so the vibe is youngish.  

## My favorite day in Nola  
Rode a public bike (Nola Blue Bikes) out to Treme neighborhood.  Got a haircut at a barber shop Treme .  Then shot across the city on the bike into the Lower Ninth Ward, to finally see what that is all about, 15 years post-Katrina hurricane damage.

## My favorite 1830s house to stay in
On Hotwire we got a room in a hotel on Esplanade that still has oil paintings of the LaMothe brother and sister who were the first occupants.  It has a pool! The pool is an unbelieveable feeling when in a hot gritty urban place like this.  30% of the rooms are ancient and wonderful. 30% are newer and comfortable.  Unfortunately 30% are across the street in a less remarkable property, still comfortable and still with pool priveleges.  The location is a 3 minute walk from Frenchmen street, which is a much better alternative for drinking and music than Bourbon or Bergundy streets.  

## 12 Years a Slave
The actual tragic scene where Jim Northrop was "sold" (I cannot even believe that is a thing you can do to a father, brother, husband) is right kitty corner from LaMothe House.  

## Eating Cheaper
Restaurant eating is expensive, even for a divey place.  Shrimp and grits was $20 around here so to stay on something like a budget in New Orleans, the eating near La Mothe is best if you go to the several delicatessans: Verte Mart or a couple others. One is 24 hours, withing two blocks of Jean LaFite House Hotel.  In the map, search "fruit", "vegetables", or at least "sandwiches" maybe.
