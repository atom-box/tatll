# Teepublic   
Teepublic.com is a shop where hundreds of creators make designs and you can order them on five or six shirt styles.  Here is a record of how some of the styles fit.    
  
## Classic T Shirt  
Men's medium, fits great, feels great  
  
## Heavyweight, Boxy fit  
Men's medium, actually tight in stomach :P but good length ratio, feels great  
  
## Classic T-Shirt   
Men's fit, unisex medium, best for my gut, feels acceptable   
  
## Vintage Wash T-Shirt  
Men's medium, tightish in the stomach, feels acceptable  
  
## Heavyweight T-Shirt, Female fit  
Women's medium, decent, she likes it, not particularly "heavyweight"     
  
## Stickers  
All shirts come as postage free stickers if you are already buying shirts, in case you want some as an activist
