## Installing Oracle on Ubuntu Linux

There are ways to install Oracle products locally to Linux [1](https://dbaontap.com/2017/08/20/install-sql-developer-ubuntu/) [2](https://dev.to/ishakantony/how-to-install-oracle-sql-developer-on-ubuntu-20-04-3jpd). Since I am just playing around, I have decided to use Oracle in the __browser__ by starting their cloud trial subscription.

## Steps

Getting started in their cloud took about 15 minutes.

[Make an account](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com) for a free trial. They will ask for your credit card.

[Set Up](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/access-traditional-cloud-account-services.html) the actual stuff in your cloud.

## What is free

Similar to Amazon, developers can get a free trial account but unlike AWS, part of the account seems to be perpetual. Oracle calls this core part "AlwaysFree" cloud services.

The always free services you can use for an unlimited time:
- two Oracle dbs with Application Express
- SQL Developer
- two VMs

I suspect things that I want to use, like all the time, are going to be behind the paywall. Like I need to use Business Intelligence data visualizer.

## What Linux means in Oracle-land

Searching the term Linux comes up with various disparate things at Oracle.  There is [a version of the Linux kernel](https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-downloads.html) to run in VMs sort of like AWS has Amazon Linux.  It is a version of Red Hat Linux. And then Oracle makes Java, so there is a Linux version of Java to download. And finally, you can download the Oracle DB itself, which is what I was looking for and ended up not using, because I am using their cloud to play with Oracle SQL db instead of installing it locally.

## Homescreen

Once you are signed in to Oracle Cloud, the User Interface looks very AWS-ish:
