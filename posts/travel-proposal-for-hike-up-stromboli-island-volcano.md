## Places mentioned in this guide    

* Stromboli - an island rising from nowhere, way out in the ocean, near Italy
* Stromboli - also the volcano which covers 80% of that island's surface, and erupts noisily twice a day
* Italy - a backdrop for awesomeness
* The National Museo di Archaeoliggia - More ancient imperial stuff than you can imagine
* Pompeii - an hour outside of Naples. Half of it has never been excavated. You can walk between the hundred houses. There's graffiti, ancient toilets, a tiny arena for the AAA ball club / gladiators
* Herculaneum - in case Pompeii isn't enough
* Italiano - like Spanish but easier
* Ferry boat - leaves Naples at dinner time, doesn't drop you off until 5 am, so you sleep in a little bunk room.
* Napoli (Naples) - Great town: has a soccer team, has stone urinals on the street.  Home of all Neopolitan things, i.e. the Margarita pizza, banana gelato
* Optional: Tunisia, where Luke Skywalker lived. Reached from the same ferry in Naples that goes to Stromboli  

## Cost to fly Chicago to Napoli

$700USD round trip

## Danger level of the volcano

Manageable. You can sort of see where most of the rocks come down during the eruptions.
Time up and down: 9am to 4pm.  Very civilized; no early rising required.
