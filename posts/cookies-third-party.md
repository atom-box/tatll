## Hubspot Notes
[The Death of the Third-Party Cookie: What Marketers Need to Know About Google's 2022 Phase-Out](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out)
* Chrome Browser popularity peaked five years ago.  But it is still 2/3 of the desktop browser market .  2/3 Chrome, including mobile. 1/10 Safari
* Consider fingerprints as the post 3rd party cookie?
* Safari and Firefox have blocked 3rd party cookies for a long time
* If you're just aiming to track your website's visitors' behaviors, preferences, and basic demographics only while they're on your website, you probably won't be deeply impacted by this change.
* Zero party: customer explicitly is giving information 
* Zero party first coined in 2018 by Forrester.com
* Zero party is things they tell you when you ask them: intentions to buy, communication preferences.
* First party cookies are all the things they did on your site. Importantly this includes their return and prior visits
* First party cookie examples: remembering passwords, basic data about the visitor, and other preferences.
* First party: customer is mostly unaware of the collecting
* Second party data is B2B. It was collected by that company and the two of you exchange the data for mutual benefit.
* Second party: Airline and hotel selling/buying data. Shoe company and clothing company buying and selling data.  Customer doesn't realistically know they are doing this.
* Third party data is purchased
* Third party brings in: what folks do elsewhere, outside of your site. You should not be asking about that, since they didn't exactly give that permission in any enlightened way.
* Third party sends out your message: a retargeting list that can be used to send ads to your past visitors or people with similar web profiles. You stalk people into other places they go.
* Third party is like tracer that you allow a martech company to stalk your site visitors with

## Google Chrome Plans 
Source: [Goodbye Third Party Cookies, Is Zero and First Party the Answer: Osano](https://example.com)
Google Privacy Sandbox will roll out incrementally late 2022 and all of 2023. Mid 2024 Chrome will not support third party cookies.
The claim is that visitors will be bundled as groups: still reachable as a demographic but not as individuals.
You will still be able to send ads to them, but they will no longer show up at your site volunteering so much information.
