## Their thoughts in A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door by Jack Schneider, Jennifer Berkshire
* A great way to fight extremism. 
* Misconception: expecting schools to fight poverty is unrealistic. That high bar, sets them up to be failures, right out of the gate. They do create opportunity. 
* Phase 1 is fund public and private (AZ). Phase 2 is cut one of those at a time and eventually fund neither (my analogy would be: it's like you can't pay your cell carrier bill and you switch to a carrier offering you a lower price, which then expires after 4 months. Maybe now you have no phone at all and you can't switch back: what you had is gone and a salesperson or ad campaign received credit for getting you to switch). 
* Loss of education for everyone hurts everyone.
* Loss of education for everyone is an inequality driver.  True: decent schools don't eliminate inequality but eliminating schools will definitely exacerbate inequality.
* "Land of equal opportunity" has ever been an unfunded slogan. 
* The pandemic, first two years of Biden admin showed the possibilities around poverty elimination.
* What AZ is doing to their schools budget is heading them towards a cliff.  The Grover Norquist cliff. The Milton Friedman cliff.  

## My idea  
* Possible cleavage point: Explain clearly that vouchers are not forever and they're not for everywhere nor everyone. 
* Pointing out that schools have not decreased poverty, is insincere, coming from folks who have no desire to fight poverty.
