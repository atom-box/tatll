These are notes summarizing [Episode 396](https://changelog.com/podcast/396) of the Changelog podcast: __De-Google-ing your website analytics__  with Marko Saric & Uku TÃ¤ht.

How lightweight are Analytics? A comparison of the script loaded by each:  
Google analytics JS file: 47kB  
Matomo analytics JS file: 20 kB  
Plausible analytics JS file: 1kB  

GDPR compliance: of the above, only Plausible is cookie-free.  BUT this means it cannot do the real UX analysis tasks: heat maps, session recording.  Plausible also anonymizes more things: visitor ID and IP address are both anonymized.  

*(Plausible is too stripped down...seems like a good use case for lots of things that are developed by teams of one or two people. Any larger team would benefit from site insights from Matomo.)*
