```
I live in the United States. If I have 
finite time and money to contribute, 
which causes should I focus on in 2025 
and 2026? 
Choose from the five following causes: 
pro-immigrants 
pro-democracy
slowing climate change
campaign finance reform
healthcare reform
```

That’s a smart, grounded question — and in 2025–2026, with limited time and money, it's essential to **focus on causes with the highest leverage** and **realistic pathways to impact**.

Here's a breakdown and a final recommendation:

---

## 🔥 Top Priorities (2025–2026)

### 🟦 1. **Pro-Democracy** ✅ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Why:**

* Authoritarianism, voter suppression, and disinformation are active threats.
* 2026 is a **critical midterm** — control of state legislatures and House districts could entrench minority rule or help restore democratic norms.
* Pro-democracy efforts also protect *every other cause* on your list.

**Best use of time/money:**

* Support orgs fighting gerrymandering, voter intimidation, and state-level election subversion (e.g., **Democracy Docket**, **WFP**, **State courts**, **Ballot initiatives**).
* Get involved in **election protection**, not just persuasion.

**Leverage:** 🟩 High
**Momentum:** 🟧 Mixed (but urgent)
**Scalability:** 🟩 Excellent

---

### 🟨 2. **Slowing Climate Change** ✅ **TIED FOR SECOND**

**Why:**

* Federal climate policy depends on **who holds Congress**.
* Climate wins are now coming from **state-level mandates**, utility board elections, and city policies.
* This is a **"now or never"** decade.

**Best use of time/money:**

* Support **state-level policy orgs** (like Evergreen Action, local chapters of Sunrise, or Sierra Club Political Committee).
* Back climate-focused candidates for **utility commissions**, **county boards**, and **state legislatures**.

**Leverage:** 🟩 High (especially at state/local level)
**Momentum:** 🟧 Moderate (climate has attention but lacks scale)
**Scalability:** 🟩 Strong with targeted pressure

---

## 🟧 Secondary Priorities

### 🟦 3. **Pro-Immigrants**

**Why:**

* Immigration is a moral, humanitarian, and economic issue.
* Congress likely won't pass comprehensive reform, but **executive policy** and **local sanctuary laws** matter.

**Best use of time/money:**

* Local immigrant rights orgs, **legal defense funds**, and **ballot initiatives** (e.g., driver's licenses, city policies).
* If you live near ICE activity or state-level crackdowns, this is higher priority.

**Leverage:** 🟨 Moderate (high locally)
**Momentum:** 🟥 Weak nationally
**Scalability:** 🟧 Good via legal advocacy + policy

---

### 🟥 4. **Healthcare Reform**

**Why:**

* Medicare for All is stalled; incremental reforms depend on **Congressional balance**.
* State-level reforms (like public options) are hard to sustain politically.

**Best use of time/money:**

* Back **state ballot initiatives** (e.g., Medicaid expansion where possible), **defense against cuts**, and **drug pricing reform**.
* Build pressure through aligned candidates (WFP, OR, etc.).

**Leverage:** 🟨 Low (unless targeted)
**Momentum:** 🟥 Low nationally
**Scalability:** 🟧 Medium with electoral work

---

### 🟥 5. **Campaign Finance Reform**

**Why:**

* Citizens United still stands.
* Most progress is legal (e.g., court decisions) or **municipal reform**, not national law.

**Best use of time/money:**

* Support groups working to limit dark money at **state and city levels**.
* **Invest in democracy reform first**, which indirectly enables this goal.

**Leverage:** 🟥 Low short-term
**Momentum:** 🟥 Weak (overshadowed by broader democracy fights)
**Scalability:** 🟨 Long-term potential, slow pace

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION (2025–2026)

Focus your **limited time and money** on:

### 🥇 **#1: Pro-Democracy**

It protects all other causes. Without functioning democratic institutions, climate, healthcare, and immigrant protections all become harder or impossible.

### 🥈 **#2: Slowing Climate Change**

Because the **window is closing**, and every **state or local win matters** — especially in energy, transportation, and land use.

If you still have room for a third priority, consider **Pro-Immigrant work** at the **local or regional level** — it’s morally urgent and often underfunded.
