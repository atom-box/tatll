## Door 

Put yourself in their shoes.  
Your not here to sell a product your here because of an important election, because of what's at stake. Why their vote is important. How to get their vote counted.

### Charmingly disarming:
Hi are you David Kaplan.  I'm Kate McNeil , (by the way you have a really nice garden)...

### Get right to it  
#### Identify what you represent and why you're out here
I'm out here talking to our neighbors to see if we can get their support for _______  in November.  

#### Eyes

### Door 1

Hi are you Lauren?  My name is Julia, I'm a volunteer for Pete for America. And we're out here talking to voters today,
SINCE THE ELECTION IS ON MARCH 3RD.
Q: Have you thought much about who you're going to be voting for?  
(a little bit, yeah)
Have you been watching the debates?

Totally understand.
So, can I ask you what some of your top values as a voter? 
(1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
Canvasser stays totally listen, zero verbal response, intense listen only mode.
Theres heavy stuff, now, absolutely.
So, one of the pieces is I teach High School and what brought me to Pete is
