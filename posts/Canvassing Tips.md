# Generic script 
This is a bit better opening than the one given to me by my Madtown O's  

## Introduction

### Greet the person warmly.
    "Hello! How are you today?"

### Introduce yourself and the campaign.
    "My name is [Your Name], and I’m volunteering with [Candidate's Name]'s presidential campaign. We’re out today talking to voters about the upcoming election. Do you have a few minutes to chat?"

## Engage with the Voter

### Ask if they’re familiar with the candidate.
    "Are you familiar with [Candidate's Name]?"
        If yes: "Great! What do you think about the campaign so far?"
        If no or unsure: "No worries! I’d love to share a little about [Candidate's Name] and why we believe [he/she/they] is the right choice for president."

## Briefly highlight the candidate’s key messages.
    "One of the reasons I support [Candidate's Name] is because [he/she/they] are fighting for [policy 1, e.g., healthcare reform, job creation, climate action]. [Candidate's Name] also stands for [policy 2, e.g., affordable education, protecting voting rights, etc.]. Do any of these issues resonate with you?"

## Listen to Their Concerns

### Ask about issues they care about.
    "What are some of the issues that are most important to you this election?"

### Acknowledge and align with their concerns.
    "That’s such an important issue. [Candidate's Name] is really focused on [related policy], and [he/she/they] have a detailed plan to address that by [mention a relevant policy action]."

## Call to Action

### Ask for their support.
    "Can we count on your support for [Candidate's Name] in the upcoming election?"
        If yes: "That’s wonderful! Every vote is critical this year, and we really appreciate your support."
        If unsure: "I understand it’s a big decision. If you’d like more information, I can provide you with a website where you can learn more about [Candidate's Name] and the campaign."
        If no: "Thank you for your time! I really appreciate hearing your perspective."

### Encourage further involvement.
    "We’re also looking for more people to join us in getting the word out. Would you be interested in volunteering or helping spread the word about [Candidate's Name]?"

### Remind them about voting.
    "Will you be voting in the upcoming election? If you need any information about where or how to vote, I’d be happy to help with that too."

## Closing

### Thank them for their time.
    "Thanks so much for your time today. I hope you have a great day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions about [Candidate's Name]."

## Door 

Put yourself in their shoes.  
Your not here to sell a product your here because of an important election, because of what's at stake. Why their vote is important. How to get their vote counted.

### Charmingly disarming:
Hi are you David Kaplan.  I'm Kate McNeil , (by the way you have a really nice garden)...

### Get right to it  
#### Identify what you represent and why you're out here
I'm out here talking to our neighbors to see if we can get their support for _______  in November.  

#### Eyes 
Don't look at anything except them: no script, no phone.  

#### Invite and have a conversation. Engage them before touching any points.
...I totally see that and I feel a lot of that too.  That's why I'm volunteering - because she is in favor of ...

#### Close the deal - When you  see the nod of understanding
Can I get you to register by mail?  If you vote by mail you can drop it off, and skip the line.  


It's been nice to meet you.  Hey would you like a lawn sign?

### Door 1
Amiable, but uncommitted door  
Hi are you Lauren?  My name is Julia, I'm a volunteer for Pete for America. And we're out here talking to voters today,
SINCE THE ELECTION IS ON MARCH 3RD.
Q: Have you thought much about who you're going to be voting for?  
(a little bit, yeah)
Have you been watching the debates? 
(no)
Totally understand.
So, can I ask you what some of your top values as a voter? 
(1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
Canvasser stays totally listen, zero verbal response, intense listen only mode.
Theres heavy stuff, now, absolutely.
So, one of the pieces is I teach High School and what brought me to Pete is
. . . 
(response)
So I will encourage you to vote.
