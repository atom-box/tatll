# Notes  
The presenters, Madeline and Ann announced the purpose. Because well-organized groups of Indivisible already exist on east and west sides of our town, this meeting was to announce her coach-ship. She has years at the head of Citizens Climate Action Lobby and now she prefers to stay lateral to the existing big Indivisible chapters: she can incubate and coach your little startups. So in a sense, Madeline was suggesting a Y-Combinator for democracy.   Too, it reminded me of the Kung Fu move as seen recently in Wu Kong's Journey to the West: power-of-a-thousand-hairs.    
  
My impression, entering the room, is that this country is a cloud, waiting for a seed crystal. Attendance was high; people need little convincing to show up at a meeting like this and do something like they've never done before.   

When she said "watched any Indivisible trainings?"  only five hands went up out of fifty people. So this is still early days of spreading the word, unfortunately.  Note to myself: plenty of flyering and door to door to do around here.  The message could really be: have hope, as you see fit, either join the madisonindivisibleeast.org, or call Madeline for loose coaching, or at least, get on the phone tree: start getting news from #nokings and similar phone trees of information.   

(We are so far behind schedule. We are in a rebuilding year, but at least we have a team and we are not getting relegated down a league. We are too late to save the next couple of years.  Indivisible will be great for a 60 month plan.  For the 18 month plan, we can at least be an ally, like Sunrise Movement, hoping that a hero at the top steps up.  Maybe that will be the 18 month hope: our meager moves now can force-multiply to enable a hero in the top places. Like the heros in top places of 2020.)
