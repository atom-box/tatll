(Response by ChatGPT to three prompts) 

 
## Prompt 1
*Which groups have done the most to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision? Are they conservative or liberal?*

Efforts to overturn the Supreme Court’s *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010) decision have come overwhelmingly from **liberal and progressive** groups. These organizations argue that *Citizens United* unleashed a flood of corporate and dark money into American politics by allowing unlimited independent political spending by corporations and unions.

### Major Groups Leading the Effort:

1. **Move to Amend**

   * **Political orientation**: Progressive/Liberal
   * **Mission**: Advocates for a constitutional amendment to state that money is not speech and that corporations are not people.
   * **Tactics**: Grassroots organizing, ballot initiatives, lobbying for a 28th Amendment.

2. **Public Citizen**

   * **Political orientation**: Liberal
   * **Mission**: Promotes a constitutional amendment to overturn *Citizens United* and supports stricter campaign finance laws.
   * **Tactics**: Legal advocacy, public education, petitions.

3. **Common Cause**

   * **Political orientation**: Generally nonpartisan but progressive-leaning
   * **Mission**: Campaign finance reform and anti-corruption measures, including a reversal of *Citizens United*.
   * **Tactics**: Legal action, lobbying, public campaigns.

4. **End Citizens United**

   * **Political orientation**: Liberal/Democratic
   * **Mission**: Elect pro-reform Democrats and push for campaign finance reform, including reversing *Citizens United*.
   * **Tactics**: Endorsing candidates, fundraising, lobbying for legislation.

5. **American Promise**

   * **Political orientation**: Centrist to progressive
   * **Mission**: Bipartisan effort for a 28th Amendment to address campaign finance reform.
   * **Tactics**: Engages with conservatives and moderates as well as liberals to build broad support.

### Conservative Efforts?

Very few **conservative** or **right-leaning** groups have made *reversing* *Citizens United* a priority. In fact, many prominent conservative legal organizations, such as the **Federalist Society**, **Heritage Foundation**, and others, **supported** the *Citizens United* ruling as a win for free speech. However:

* A **small number of libertarian-leaning** or **anti-corruption conservatives** have criticized the effects of the ruling, especially on political transparency, but they have not mounted major campaigns to overturn it.

### Summary:

The **most organized and active opposition** to *Citizens United* has come from **liberal and progressive groups**, often tied to the broader movement for campaign finance reform. Conservative groups, by contrast, have largely **supported or defended** the ruling on First Amendment grounds.


Among the five groups—**Move to Amend**, **Public Citizen**, **Common Cause**, **End Citizens United**, and **American Promise**—the group that has arguably made the **most tangible progress** toward overturning *Citizens United* is **American Promise**. Here's why:

---

### 🥇 **American Promise**

* **Key Achievement**: Has built the **broadest bipartisan and cross-partisan support** for a constitutional amendment—critical for actually passing one (which requires two-thirds of Congress and ratification by 38 states).
* **State-Level Successes**: Helped pass **resolutions or ballot measures in over 20 states** (e.g., Colorado, Montana, California, and Massachusetts) supporting an amendment to overturn *Citizens United*.
* **Municipal Momentum**: Hundreds of cities and towns have passed similar resolutions with American Promise’s support.
* **Bipartisan Appeal**: Actively recruits conservatives and moderates, such as former Republican officials and military veterans, to speak on the issue.
* **Unique Role**: Focuses heavily on organizing state-level action and building the conditions needed for ratification—a step others often leave out.

---

### Honorable Mentions:

#### **Move to Amend**

* **Strengths**: Deep grassroots organizing and strong ideological clarity (“money is not speech, corporations are not people”).
* **Impact**: Introduced the “We the People Amendment” in Congress multiple times, but has **not gained substantial traction in Congress**.
* **Limitation**: Less bipartisan appeal, so lower chance of building the coalition needed for constitutional change.

#### **End Citizens United**

* **Strengths**: Massive fundraising and candidate endorsements in federal elections (especially pro-reform Democrats).
* **Impact**: Helps elect candidates who **oppose Citizens United**, but focuses more on **electoral wins** than on constitutional amendments.
* **Limitation**: Deeply partisan, which limits broader amendment movement success.

#### **Public Citizen** and **Common Cause**

* **Strengths**: Long histories of effective policy advocacy, litigation, and public education.
* **Impact**: Played major roles in lawsuits and in supporting other groups’ campaigns.
* **Limitation**: Focus more broadly on campaign finance and democracy issues than on *Citizens United* specifically.

---

### Conclusion:

**American Promise** has made the most structural progress toward overturning *Citizens United* because it’s working to build the only thing that can actually do it: a **constitutional amendment** backed by a **bipartisan supermajority** across **states and Congress**. The road is long, but they're methodically working the required steps.

## Final Thought:

These groups are **not all the same**, but they each **contribute to the normalization or advancement of fascist-adjacent politics**—whether through policy, violence, rhetoric, or disinformation. The **greatest danger** lies in the **overlap between fringe militancy and mainstream legitimization**, especially when political, judicial, and media systems fail to check them.
