# Style and Language 
What style and language gives the clearest, most sincere engagment?  

Recognize we are big tent, and there will come a time for playing offense, but most of 2025 and 2026 will be defense.  It's the job of No Kings to say No. It's right in the title.  

## Summary of what we are against

### Josh Marshall version
[Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-subtle-genius-of-no-kings)  
- The politicized Justice Department
- Violent ICE paramilitaries and Kavanaugh stops
- Gutting and corrupting the civil service
- Election rigging?
- Military invasions of American cities
- Flagrant corruption across all of the Trump administration 

### Evan Genest (me)
I'm parking my own bullet points here. 
- Changing spending already voted by another branch of the government  
- Opposite of correct response when there is national violence
- Preference to foreign powers, if they are dictators, over 50% of America  
- Treating our day to day as his own reality show, desperate for ratings
- His constituencies: Ratings > MAGA > Foreign dictators > Evangelical Christians >> Liberal Americans and Blue Cities/States
