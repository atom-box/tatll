## Prompts Examples
Write three captions for a social post about our new line of sunglasses for robots  
Give me three ideas for tshirt graphics that would appeal to llamas
Find me some recipes for hungry pirates  
(coding)  

  
## Examples  
Credit card fraud behavior  
Recommender systems  
Video and voice of the professor Andrew Ng  

## Actions (in descending order of relevance to me)
Supervised learning (labeling things)
Generative AI
Unsupervised learning 
Reinforcement learning

## Contrast these two terms
LLM vs Generative AI
GAI - can make the three things: text, images, sound
LLM is a subset; it is predictive text, basically, as opposed to filtering, which is how images are made  

## How LLMs Work 
(Large Language Models)  
Predictive text is a clear example of this.  
The number of inputs it had, to lead to this, are 
nearly a trillion input examples.  

## Prompts to write
Rewrite this for clarity:
wyxy

Write a 300 word story for ___ audience to encourage them to ____. 

## Explaining A.I. to a newbie
What is AI good for?
The answer is difficult for the same reason that Electricity or Computers are complicated.

## Not practical as web-interface; do LM app, instead
Read several (hundreds?) of eails and sort it into a bin or find the category.
