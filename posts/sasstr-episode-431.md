## TLDR

Retention is the new acquisition.  
Big on Upselling and Cross-selling.   

## Net Revenue Retention as a  Metric

Kopp talks a lot about NRR in this episode. One definition of NRR is here, from https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-215709 :  
  
*Net Revenue Retention, sometimes called Net Dollar Retention, is an indicator of "whether sales from customers once acquired will increase or decrease in the future.*


## Takewaway
