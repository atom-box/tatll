## Introduction
When your place of work is outside of your home, the physical movement from home to work is called commuting. But what if your workplace and bedroom are 10 feet away from each other? Or are in fact the same room?
  
In that case, it is still important to commute. And I can tell you why and how. 

## How
The commute is circular or semi-circular if your work from home. If you and your partner both work from home, you can bookend the day with a neighborhood loop on foot or on bikes to a light errand, such as buying milk or to the bakery.

A semicircular commute when working from home can be to walk to a cafe, McDonalds, or library for the morning, bringing your laptop.  I have even done fine Zoom meetings at those places, using cheap noise cancelling headphones (30USD). 


## Partner Time
Walking while both facing forward is like time spent in a car. The conversation is different. If you or your partner are male, you might really know what I mean with this one. It's a different kind of conversation.

## Thinking Time
If you are walking solo, the thinking can be very different. Cal Newport is a Comp Sci professor, at MIT, and he specializes in time hacking his day. To double dip on the health benefits of walking to work, he pre-defines a good "walking problem" the night before his commute. He defines a clear outcome and the steps to that outcome. 

His book is Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport

## Serendipity
If your personality type delights in surprises and serendipity, you can scratch that itch by getting outside, I think.

## New research: Walking backwards
The muscles are opposite. If you do it on an incline you will really feel like you are achieving the benefits of paying a membership to a gym.

## New research: Walking inhaling with your mouth closed 
Your nose gives off nitric oxide compounds, which are a neurotransmitter. When you inhale through your nose, the NO compounds enter your lungs and dilate the vessels, activating more of the deeper parts of the lung to absorb oxygen readily.

## IRL Relationships
We are all hairless apes and the mental health that other primates receive from a social context also acrue to us.  
Mental health flows from passive context.  Eavesdropping, people watching, social norming, being a part of a thing can be passive but still benefit 
Mental health flows from relationships. 
  
There's an accountant, lives at the opposite end of my block, Bruce.  He's not a chatty person. The first 10 times I saw him on the street we said Hi. Maybe Hi plus. But I've seen him 100 times now so we have a lot more to say by this point: I know how his grandfather, his life in Ohio, and I found out he works one floor up from where my partner works. So now they can share some stories about that building on the UW campus.
